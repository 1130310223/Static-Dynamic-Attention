All	right	.
Now	listen	,	honey	,	there	's	a	little	something	I	wanna	talk	over	with	you	.

Now	this	is	what	you	got	to	do	.

When	does	this	lion	tamer	appear	?

9	:	45	,	to	be	exact	.
How	do	you	know	?
Why	,	it	's	here	on	the	programme	.
[	Audience	applauding	]

Tira	,	the	million-	dollar	beauty	!

[	Audience	applauding	]
You	see	her	?
[	Lively	instrumental	music	continues	playing	]
She	is	something	special	,	isn	't	she	?
I	'll	say	,	she	's	fascinating	.

Come	on	,	talk	to	me	.

Come	on	,	get	up	.
Come	on	,	speak	up	for	yourself	.

What	's	the	matter	with	you	?
You	gotta	be	sitting	?
Get	up	.

Yeah	,	you	'll	end	up	as	a	rug	.
Come	on	,	you	're	holding	up	the	works	,	you	mug	.

That	's	it	.
Remember	my	contract	,	baby	.
--------------------
[	Fanfare	playing	]
That	was	great	,	wasn	't	it	?
I	didn	't	see	anything	great	about	it	.
Look	here	,	I	happen	to	know	her	publicity	man	.
How	would	you	all	like	to	go	back	...
I	'm	for	that	.
Oh	,	no	.
Let	's	do	,	Alicia	.
We	don	't	care	about	seeing	the	rest	of	the	show	,	do	we	?
No	.
--------------------
And	it	'll	be	a	lot	of	fun	knowing	her	.
It	's	absurd	to	make	such	a	fuss	over	an	ordinary	circus	performer	.
Are	we	going	,	or	aren	't	we	?
We	certainly	are	.
Well	,	let	's	go	.
Very	well	.
I	suppose	I	must	bow	before	the	general	enthusiasm	.
Beulah	,	that	's	another	performance	under	my	belt	and	I	still	got	the	face	.
Bless	you	,	child	,	I	hopes	you	always	keeps	it	.
It	's	my	fortune	.
--------------------
When	I	was	born	with	this	face	,	it	was	the	same	as	striking	oil	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Beulah	laughing	]
You	sure	do	believe	in	that	horoscope	,	don	't	you	,	Miss	Tira	?
It	tells	me	everything	.
I	wouldn	't	make	a	move	without	it	.
Yes	,	indeed	,	Tira	enjoys	meeting	people	.
You	'll	find	her	a	regular	fellow	.
She	has	to	be	in	the	mood	.
That	is	,	her	work	is	very	strenuous	and	stars	will	be	temperamental	at	times	.
--------------------
Yes	,	so	I	've	heard	.
Yes	.
Excuse	me	just	a	moment	.

Evening	,	Mr.	Madigan	.

May	I	see	Miss	Tira	,	please	?

Yes	,	sir	.

Come	in	,	Flea	.
Are	you	in	the	mood	?
For	what	?

I	can	get	that	way	.

MR.	BOND	:
--------------------
Thank	you	.
Mr.	And	Mrs.	Fletcher	,	Mr.	And	Mrs.	Bond	.
MRS.	BOND	:
How	do	you	do	?
FLEA	:
Mr.	Lawrence	and	Miss	Hatton	.
Pleased	to	meet	you	,	won	't	you	sit	down	?
MRS.	BOND	:
Thank	you	.
Won	't	you	sit	down	?
--------------------
If	you	don	't	mind	,	I	'd	rather	wait	in	the	lounge	.
Pleased	to	have	met	you	,	anyway	.
Now	,	let	's	see	,	where	were	we	?
I	was	about	to	say	,	we	really	came	back	to	tell	you	what	a	thrill	you	gave	us	.
Thank	you	,	I	'm	glad	you	liked	my	act	.
It	is	kind	of	unusual	.
I	don	't	see	how	you	get	up	enough	courage	to	thrust	your	head	in	that	beast	's	mouth	.
I	often	wonder	myself	.
It	seems	terribly	dangerous	.
It	is	,	that	's	why	I	have	to	carry	a	rod	,	I	mean	a	gun	.
--------------------
I	had	to	shoot	a	lion	once	.
Really	,	was	he	mad	?
He	wasn	't	exactly	pleased	about	it	.
Would	you	be	so	good	as	to	autograph	my	programme	?
Love	to	.
MRS.	BOND	:
I	should	think	you	dread	every	new	performance	.
It	is	kind	of	wearing	on	the	nerves	.
Of	course	,	I	don	't	intend	to	do	this	all	my	life	.
Thanks	.
--------------------
And	mine	?
[	Tira	murmurs	in	agreement	]
I	don	't	believe	after	all	this	excitement	,	that	you	'd	enjoy	being	idle	.
I	'll	be	doing	something	.
Say	,	I	've	got	a	great	idea	.
Why	don	't	you	have	supper	with	us	?
MR.	BOND	:
We	'd	love	to	have	you	.
Thanks	,	but	I	've	previous	engagements	.
That	's	too	bad	.
--------------------
It	's	been	such	a	great	pleasure	to	meet	you	.
Thank	you	.
Permit	me	to	say	,	I	think	you	're	perfectly	wonderful	.
Coming	from	a	woman	,	that	's	a	big	compliment	.
MR.	BOND	:
Delighted	.
It	's	been	charming	to	meet	you	lovely	people	.
MR.	FLETCHER	:
Have	a	lovely	evening	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
Good	night	.
Anyway	,	you	've	been	awfully	kind	.
I	'll	never	forget	you	.
No	one	ever	does	.
Good	night	.
Good	night	.
FLEA	:
Swell	person	,	isn	't	she	?
I	'm	so	glad	we	met	her	.
How	about	taking	a	look	at	the	lion	she	works	with	?
--------------------
MR.	FLETCHER	:
Good	idea	.
MRS.	FLETCHER	:
We	'll	wait	for	Alicia	.
MRS.	BOND	:
Yes	.
We	'll	join	you	later	.
MR.	BOND	:
Until	then	.
FLEA	:
--------------------
Don	't	be	long	.
MRS.	BOND	:
All	right	.
Beulah	,	remind	me	to	tell	Flea	Madigan	to	get	that	blue	book	in	here	...	with	the	400	in	it	.
So	I	'll	know	who	's	who	and	what	's	what	in	this	town	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Mr.	Lawrence	,	huh	?
Did	you	have	a	nice	visit	with	your	lion	tamer	?
Alicia	,	she	's	marvellous	.
You	really	should	've	stayed	.
--------------------
Such	good	fun	.
Nonsense	.
I	can	't	see	why	everybody	's	so	absolutely	gaga	about	her	.
MRS.	FLETCHER	:
Not	at	all	.
ALlCIA	:
Of	course	,	she	would	impress	the	men	.
MRS.	BOND	:
Alicia	,	how	can	you	say	that	?
ALlCIA	:
--------------------
We	all	have	a	right	to	our	own	opinion	and	I	think	she	's	cruel	...	and	a	very	ill-	bred	person	.
[	Gasping	]
I	've	never	been	so
I	must	get	out	of	this	place	before	I	scream	.
Can	you	imagine	that	broad	discussing	me	in	that	manner	?
Say	,	I	like	them	brocades	.
Order	me	six	more	pair	in	the	morning	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
Is	you	in	to	anyone	else	?
--------------------
I	'm	meeting	all	comers	tonight	.
Sorry	,	I	believe	I	left	my	cane	inside	.
BEULAH	:
He	says	he	left	his	cane	.
TlRA	:
Come	in	,	Mr.	Lawrence	.
Let	's	find	it	.
It	isn	't	necessary	,	I	know	right	where	I	left	it	.
You	got	a	good	memory	.
I	ought	to	,	since	I	left	it	here	on	purpose	.
--------------------
TlRA	:
You	mean	you	planted	that	stick	?
KlRK	:
Sure	.
Had	to	find	a	way	to	see	you	alone	.
I	've	seen	your	show	three	times	and	I	think	you	're	wonderful	.
You	're	dazzling	,	beautiful	,	gorgeous	...
Wait	a	minute	,	take	it	slower	.
What	I	mean	is	,	let	's	get	better	acquainted	.
You	know	,	we	can	have	a	lot	of	fun	together	.
--------------------
You	'll	like	me	when	you	know	me	.
I	'm	not	half	bad	.
If	you	're	half	the	man	I	think	you	are	,	you	'll	do	.
I	am	.
Oh	,	well	.
Come	on	,	let	's	go	out	tonight	.
I	'll	ditch	the	crowd	.
I	told	you	I	have	a	previous	engagement	.
Break	it	.
You	'll	never	regret	it	.
--------------------
No	.
I	'd	love	to	,	but	I	've	got	to	meet	my	aunt	.
These	relatives	are	a	nuisance	at	times	.
What	about	tomorrow	?
For	breakfast	,	lunch	,	dinner	,	anything	.
Let	me	see	.
Breakfast	I	have	in	bed	,	so	that	's	out	.
TlRA	:
I	don	't	eat	lunch	,	and	dinner
We	'll	make	it	supper	tomorrow	night	.
--------------------
That	's	a	date	,	then	we	'll	go	out	.
I	like	sophisticated	men	to	take	me	out	.
I	'm	not	really	sophisticated	.
You	're	not	really	out	yet	,	either	.
You	got	me	.
Have	I	?
I	guess	I	'd	better	be	going	before	they	come	in	here	and	get	me	.
Tomorrow	night	,	then	.
That	's	the	night	.
Beulah	,	bring	me	my	horoscope	.
--------------------
Here	it	is	.
That	's	service	.
That	man	sure	is	crazy	about	you	,	ain	't	he	?
Crazy	about	me	?
The	guy	's	a	pushover	for	me	.

All	right	,	Miss	Tira	,	Mr.	Lawrence	has	arranged	for	the	account	.

[	Singing	]
And	how	.
[	Singing	]
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Singing	]
Miss	Tira	,	you	got	something	.
Something	not	bad	,	huh	?
--------------------
Not	bad	?
I	've	never	seen	such	presents	as	this	here	Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	done	give	you	.
You	sure	skinned	him	pretty	.
You	only	knowed	him	a	week	.
Yeah	,	but	what	a	week	!
He	's	crazy	about	you	,	same	as	all	the	rest	.
I	don	't	see	how	any	man	could	help	loving	you	.
I	don	't	give	them	any	help	,	they	do	it	themselves	.
You	do	keep	me	busy	keeping	track	of	your	gentleman	friends	.
I	want	to	make	it	easy	for	you	,	Beulah	...
--------------------
I	'm	thinking	about	putting	in	a	filing	system	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Men	don	't	mean	a	thing	to	me	.
Be	careful	with	that	million-	dollar	foot	.
I	don	't	know	,	but	me	and	men	do	pretty	well	together	.
What	kind	of	men	do	you	like	,	Libby	?
I	'm	just	crazy	about	dark	men	.
Dark	men	?
You	ought	to	have	a	big	time	in	Africa	.
--------------------
LlBBY	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Don	't	get	those	nails	too	short	,	or	they	'll	think	I	bite	them	.
Miss	Tira	,	I	've	been	under	the	impression	you	is	a	one-	man	woman	.
I	am	,	one	man	at	a	time	.
TlRA	:
Beulah	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Fetch	me	that	importation	.
--------------------
You	mean	this	one	?
TlRA	:
Yes	,	that	Parisian	one	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Singing	]
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
TlRA	:
[	Singing	]
Sure	does	.
--------------------
[	Singing	]
Come	on	.
TlRA	:
Is	it	a	flash	or	is	it	a	flash	?
MAlD	:
That	's	beautiful	.
I	know	it	's	beautiful	,	but	I	'm	asking	you	is	it	a	flash	?
It	's	a	flash	,	all	right	.
Kind	of	daring	,	huh	?
Not	for	you	,	it	ain	't	.
--------------------
That	's	all	I	want	to	know	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
If	that	's	that	house	detective	,	tell	him	I	'm
I	never	will	get	used	to	this	joint	.
Show	the	gentleman	in	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Get	me	my	beads	.
You	mean	that	pretty	necklace	you	just	had	give	to	you	?
Yeah	,	the	necklace	.
I	will	say	beads	.
--------------------
Pretty	,	ain	't	it	?
I	'll	say	it	is	.
I	just	wonder	how	much	money	that	costs	?
I	couldn	't	tell	you	right	now	,	but	I	have	an	idea	...
It	ain	't	no	he	,	it	's	a	she	.
Says	her	name	is	Miss	Hatton	.
Miss	who	?
Miss	Hatton	.
Pardon	me	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
--------------------
So	it	's	you	.
ALlCIA	:
You	know	why	I	'm	here	.
Hardly	.
You	see	I	'm	a	lion	tamer	,	not	a	mind	reader	.
Then	it	might	refresh	you	to	know	that	I	'm	Kirk	's	fiancee	.
Nothing	refreshing	about	that	.
I	want	to	know	just	what	you	intend	to	do	.
What	do	you	mean	?
You	know	you	're	making	a	fool	of	him	.
--------------------
He	ain	't	any	different	than	when	I	first	met	him	,	not	much	.
Everyone	knows	we	're	engaged	and	yet	you	're	deliberately	interfering	.
I	ain	't	interfering	with	nothing	.
Lf	Kirk	prefers	my	company	to	yours	...
No	,	he	doesn	't	,	he	only	imagines	he	does	.
I	'll	admit	the	boy	has	got	a	great	imagination	.
It	's	perfectly	obvious	what	your	intentions	are	.
Wait	a	minute	.
Whatever	you	're	thinking	,	you	're	wrong	.
I	only	like	him	like	a	brother	.
--------------------
You	ain	't	got	nothing	to	worry	about	.
You	're	a	liar	!
Say	,	listen	you	...	a	better	dame	than	you	once	called	me	a	liar	...	and	they	had	a	sew	her	up	in	12	different	places	.
You	're	lucky	I	'm	a	little	more	refined	than	I	used	to	be	.
And	if	you	were	as	much	a	lady	as	I	am	...	you	'd	get	out	of	here	before	I	get	real	sore	.
You	haven	't	a	streak	of	decency	in	you	.
I	don	't	show	my	good	points	to	strangers	.
I	'll	trouble	you	to	scram	.
Just	a	minute	.
ALlCIA	:
--------------------
I	realise	there	's	only	one	thing	that	will	influence	you	to	leave	Kirk	alone	.
How	much	?
TlRA	:
Beulah	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Peel	me	a	grape	.
JACK	:
I	can	't	wait	any	longer	.
You	'd	better	go	.
--------------------
I	'm	not	going	to	Texas	.
That	's	final	.
You	're	being	ridiculous	.
This	mad	infatuation	of	yours	for	this	...
lion	tamer	,	will	ruin	your	life	and	Alicia	's	,	too	.
Don	't	you	worry	about	Alicia	.
You	seem	to	forget	that	you	're	an	engaged	man	.
Jack	,	it	's	no	good	arguing	.
I	'll	handle	my	own	affairs	.
You	're	gonna	continue	with	this	woman	?
--------------------
Indefinitely	.
You	're	mad	.
Right	.
TlRA	:
Leave	that	where	you	found	it	.
Well	,	hello	,	baby	.
SLlCK	:
Here	I	am	.
TlRA	:
So	I	see	.
--------------------
When	'd	did	they	open	the	pearly	gates	for	you	?
SLlCK	:
Yesterday	.
Glad	to	see	me	?
Sure	,	don	't	I	look	it	?
And	you	ain	't	sore	.
Why	should	I	be	?
You	've	done	the	time	,	not	me	.
How	did	you	happen	to	come	up	here	?
The	show	was	laying	off	this	week	,	so	I	looks	up	Barton	.
--------------------
He	tells	me	what	a	swell	joint	you	got	here	.
You	've	done	pretty	nice	for	yourself	.
From	a	tent	to	a	penthouse	.
Yeah	,	this	is	a	great	layout	.
This	is	one	place	you	ain	't	laying	out	in	,	honey	.
I	guess	that	sort	of	means	I	don	't	exactly	fit	in	around	here	.
I	wouldn	't	say	that	.
The	whole	trouble	with	you	,	you	got	nervous	fingers	.
SLlCK	:
I	'm	all	washed	up	with	that	.
--------------------
What	are	you	figuring	on	doing	for	a	living	?
I	don	't	know	.
I	'm	sort	of	up	against	it	.
I	thought	maybe	you	might	...
Pulling	the	sob	on	me	?
No	,	I
I	'll	do	something	for	you	...	if	you	promise	to	keep	your	hands	in	your	own	pockets	.
Baby	,	I	'd	promise	you	anything	.
But	would	you	keep	it	?
Do	you	want	me	to	swear	?
--------------------
Never	mind	,	I	can	do	that	myself	.
Listen	,	go	see	Barton	.
Tell	him	I	said	to	find	something	for	you	to	do	over	there	.
And	here	,	take	this	.
But	don	't	make	a	habit	of	it	.
Get	yourself	some	clothes	so	you	start	looking	normal	again	.
Say	,	you	're	a	pal	.
You	know	there	never	was	a	dame	like	you	.
Forget	that	.
Okay	,	but	I	just	want	you	to	know	I	'm	still	warm	for	you	,	baby	.
--------------------
Maybe	I	'll	be	seeing	you	.
Make	it	soon	,	will	you	?
Get	going	.
That	guy	would	show	up	now	.
Excuse	me	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]

I	will	if	I	can	remember	it	,	if	not	,	I	'll	just	say	he	's	here	.
Perhaps	that	will	do	as	well	.
TlRA	:
Take	the	gentleman	's	hat	and	coat	.
JACK	:
Thanks	.
I	hope	I	haven	't	disturbed	you	.
Not	so	far	.
Anything	I	can	do	for	you	?
Yes	,	there	is	,	but	first	I	better	introduce	myself	.
--------------------
That	's	not	necessary	,	I	know	who	you	are	.
I	've	heard	Kirk	speak	of	you	.
Good	,	that	simplifies	matters	.
It	's	on	Kirk	's	account	I	'm	here	.
I	see	.
Let	's	sit	down	and	be	comfortable	about	it	.
I	hope	I	can	come	right	to	the	point	.
About	this	situation	between	you	and	Kirk	...	he	's	neglecting	important	business	on	your	account	.
And	there	's	Miss	Hatton	,	his	fiancee	,	to	be	considered	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
She	's	a	novel	twist	.
Of	course	,	I	know	you	have	no	liking	for	Miss	Hatton	.
She	came	in	here	,	got	nasty	,	I	had	to	put	her	in	her	place	.
Yes	,	I	heard	you	had	some	slight	misunderstanding	.
Do	you	mind	if	I	get	personal	?
Go	right	ahead	.
I	don	't	mind	if	you	get	familiar	.
It	's	all	in	the	family	.
Well	,	then	,	do	you	really	care	for	Kirk	?
I	mean	,	do	you	love	him	?
--------------------
I	don	't	know	.
See	,	my	horoscope	says	so	.
I	'm	afraid	I	don	't	understand	.
I	'm	afraid	I	don	't	understand	it	myself	sometimes	.
You	see	,	it	describes	a	guy	,	I	mean	,	a	man	like	Kirk	.
Surely	you	're	not	being	serious	.
Why	,	I	certainly	am	.
My	whole	life	is	ruled	by	astrology	.
JACK	:
Well
--------------------
What	colour	eyes	have	you	got	?
I	don	't	know	.
Fine	.
Well	,	as	you	were	saying
You	're	telling	me	simply	because	Kirk	fits	some	description	in	your	horoscope	...	that	you	'd	deliberately	break	up	things	between	him	and	Miss	Hatton	?
Maybe	it	would	be	a	good	break	for	him	.
Surely	you	wouldn	't	let	personal	dislike	destroy	their	engagement	.
Unless	,	of	course	,	you	have	serious	intentions	.
What	if	I	have	?
I	'm	afraid	that	's	impossible	.
--------------------
Listen	,	with	me	nothing	is	impossible	.
That	may	be	.
But	I	'm	here	to	tell	you	,	if	you	're	thinking	of	marrying	Kirk	,	you	better	not	count	on	it	.
TlRA	:
Kirk	sent	you	up	here	with	that	line	?
JACK	:
He	doesn	't	know	I	'm	here	.
I	get	it	.
You	figure	the	family	honour	needs	protecting	.
A	circus	dame	would	be	sort	of	a	red	leaf	on	the	family	tree	,	is	that	it	?
--------------------
Please	understand	that	it	's	been	difficult	for	me	...	to	come	here	and	talk	to	you	about	what	you	no	doubt	consider	is	none	of	my	business	.
That	's	all	right	,	I	don	't	care	.
If	someone	's	got	something	on	their	mind	,	I	like	them	to	get	it	off	.
You	're	an	unusual	sort	of	person	.
I	've	been	accused	of	that	.
As	a	matter	of	fact	,	I	'd	much	rather	have	met	you	under	pleasanter	circumstances	.
Same	here	,	there	's	no	hard	feelings	.
Of	course	not	.
I	shouldn	't	want	you	to	feel	unfriendly	toward	me	.
I	shouldn	't	want	you	to	get	the	impression	that	I	'm	just	an	adventuress	.
--------------------
I	didn	't	think	that	.
What	did	you	think	?
I	had	no	definite	idea	what	you	would	be	like	.
I	've	seen	newspaper	pictures	of	you	.
Yeah	?
Ever	seen	this	one	here	?
There	's	one	of	my	favourites	.
It	looks	just	like	you	.
It	should	,	I	posed	for	it	.
You	like	it	?
--------------------
Yes	.
You	can	have	it	.
No	,	thanks	,	I	wouldn	't	want	to	deprive	you	...
It	's	all	right	,	I	get	them	by	the	hundreds	,	frame	and	all	.
Well	,	in	that	case
Won	't	you	stay	?
I	'll	ring	for	tea	.
No	,	thanks	,	really	,	I	must	be	going	.
You	've	been	wonderful	.
You	've	been	kind	of	wonderful	yourself	.
--------------------
Thank	you	.
Now	you	'll	consider	all	I	've	said	and	try	and	bring	Kirk	to	his	senses	.
I	can	't	promise	anything	right	now	,	but	...	you	have	started	a	new	train	of	thought	in	my	mind	.
I	'll	think	it	over	and	let	you	know	what	I	decide	.
You	'd	be	doing	a	fine	thing	.
Yeah	?
Fine	for	who	?
For	all	of	us	.
You	're	kind	of	unusual	yourself	.
I	've	been	accused	of	that	.
--------------------
Now	you	can	reach	me	there	at	any	time	.
And	I	want	to	thank	you	for	the	way	you	received	me	.
And	you	can	reach	me	there	at	any	time	.
You	'll	hear	from	me	.
JACK	:
That	will	be	fine	.
You	fascinate	me	.
You	'd	better	go	.
JACK	:
Good	night	.
--------------------
[	Telephone	buzzing	]
JACK	:
Hello	.
SECRETARY	:
Good	.
Put	her	on	.
Mr.	Clayton	?
I	've	been	thinking	over	everything	you	said	and	...
I	've	made	my	decision	.
Good	.
--------------------
I	'm	glad	you	made	up	your	mind	quickly	.
I	'm	very	quick	in	a	slow	way	.
You	see	I	can	't	discuss	it	over	the	phone	.
It	's	got	a	lot	of	angles	to	it	.
You	better	come	up	and	see	me	.
I	'll	be	glad	to	.
In	fact	,	I	'll	come	over	right	away	if	it	's	convenient	for	you	.
Most	convenient	.
I	'll	tell	you	this	much	...	you	're	gonna	like	what	I	got	in	mind	.
I	'll	be	ready	.
--------------------
Goodbye	.
Hello	,	honey	.
Good	evening	,	Miss	Tira	.
If	anyone	should	call	,	I	'm	indisposed	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
TlRA	:
You	know	what	I	mean	,	don	't	you	?
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Come	here	,	dear	.
--------------------
JACK	:
I	haven	't	had	you	alone	all	evening	with	all	those	people	.
My	public	.
Let	me	take	a	good	look	at	you	.
You	were	wonderful	tonight	.
I	'm	always	wonderful	at	night	.
Yes	,	but	tonight	you	were	especially	good	.
When	I	'm	good	,	I	'm	very	good	.
But	when	I	'm	bad	...
I	'm	better	.
--------------------
Don	't	go	away	,	I	'll	be	right	back	.
[	Tira	humming	softly	]
TlRA	:
[	Singing	]
BEULAH	:
You	must	've	had	a	good	time	,	you	seem	so	happy	.
If	I	wasn	't	,	you	'd	know	it	.
Get	me	another	gown	,	Beulah	.
I	've	danced	this	one	around	all	evening	.
I	gotta	give	it	a	rest	.
--------------------
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Which	one	?
That	lucky	one	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Playing	a	soft	tune	]
[	Jack	playing	a	jazzy	tune	]
That	guy	's	got	rhythm	,	eh	?
Yes	,	I	know	what	you	means	.
Bring	out	a	couple	of	drinks	and	then	you	two	dames	can	retire	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
--------------------
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Open	up	that	door	.
Here	goes	my	big	moment	.
[	Beulah	murmurs	in	agreement	]
Don	't	stop	,	honey	,	you	put	me	in	the	mood	.
It	's	good	to	be	here	alone	with	you	,	dear	.
I	kind	of	like	it	,	too	.
The	only	thing	I	've	got	to	be	jealous	.
Of	course	,	if	I	could	only	trust	you	.
You	can	,	hundreds	have	.
--------------------
Do	you	know	I	'm	mad	about	you	?
I	could	tell	you	'd	be	,	the	first	time	I	saw	you	.
Say	,	I	must	be	transparent	.
Honey	,	you	're	just	wrapped	in	cellophane	.
Come	on	,	darling	.
Be	serious	.
You	want	me	to	?
Sure	I	do	.
All	right	,	now	I	'm	very	serious	.
I	adore	you	.
--------------------
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
How	am	I	doing	,	Beulah	?
You	're	doing	fine	,	you	're	doing	grand	.
I	'll	do	better	when	you	are	gone	,	you	rascal	,	you	!
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	,	I	know	you	will	,	ma	'am	.
Great	gals	,	huh	?
[	Tira	playing	a	soft	tune	]
Honey	,	I	wonder	if	you	realise	just	how	much	you	mean	to	me	.
--------------------
I	've	never	been	so	happy	in	my	life	.
You	mean	that	?
I	guess	love	is	a	wonderful	thing	.
Yes	,	I	've	heard	it	highly	praised	.
[	Singing	]
Move	over	,	honey	,	and	don	't	stop	.
I	'll	never	stop	.
[	Singing	]
Darling	,	you	can	never	guess	how	much	I	love	you	.
I	'll	never	guess	,	you	've	got	to	you	show	me	.
--------------------
Just	give	me	the	chance	.
You	'll	get	it	.
[	Singing	]
I	could	be	your	slave	.
I	guess	that	could	be	arranged	.
[	Singing	]
What	have	you	done	to	me	?
You	ought	to	know	.
[	Singing	]
What	are	you	gonna	do	about	it	?
--------------------
[	Romantic	instrumental	music	]
What	's	this	in	the	paper	about	you	marrying	this	rich	guy	,	Clayton	?
If	it	's	publicity	it	's	great	,	and	if	it	ain	't	,	it	's	no	good	.
I	'm	quitting	the	show	.
You	're	quitting	?
Yeah	,	I	'm	sick	of	this	racket	.
I	found	the	right	man	,	I	'm	gonna	get	married	.
You	can	't	quit	.
You	got	a	five	year	contract	with	me	.
Yeah	?
--------------------
Did	you	ever	read	it	?
It	says	for	a	good	cause	you	could	give	a	two	week	's	notice	.
I	'm	giving	you	that	notice	now	.
But	you	ain	't	got	no	good	cause	.
Marriage	is	a	good	enough	cause	for	anything	.
BlG	BlLL	:
You	can	't	do	that	to	me	and	get	away	with	it	.
No	?
What	's	my	picture	doing	by	that	skunk	?
I	figured	it	belonged	there	.
--------------------
What	do	you	mean	?
Everybody	used	to	call	me	"	The	Bull	.	"
You	may	be	the	bull	to	them	,	but	you	're	just	plain	skunk	to	me	.
BlG	BlLL	:
I	got	everything	set	.
All	right	.
But	suppose	Tira	gets	back	before	we	spring	it	.
I	got	the	chauffer	fixed	...	so	there	'll	be	trouble	with	the	car	on	the	road	.
Now	,	get	going	.
Every	minute	counts	.
--------------------
Can	't	you	hurry	and	get	that	thing	fixed	,	I	gotta	get	back	.
I	'm	expecting	Mr.	Clayton	at	the	apartment	.
CHAUFFER	:
Doing	the	best	I	can	,	ma	'am	.
Your	best	is	no	good	,	try	your	worst	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Say	,	where	are	we	?
I	thought	we	were	in	Jersey	.
CHAUFFER	:
We	're	in	Jersey	,	ma	'am	.
--------------------
You	sure	you	didn	't	take	the	wrong	road	and	land	in	Brazil	?
CHAUFFER	:
No	,	ma	'am	.
Come	on	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
Tira	.
SLlCK	:
What	do	you	want	?
You	're	Clayton	.
--------------------
I	know	all	about	you	and	Tira	.
But	that	's	all	finished	.
I	've	been	away	,	but	I	'm	back	again	and	she	ain	't	wanting	no	change	.
We	're	going	on	just	the	same	as	before	.
Get	it	?
No	,	I	don	't	get	it	.
Where	's	Miss	Tira	?
She	ain	't	here	now	.
She	knew	you	was	coming	and	she	didn	't	want	to	see	you	.
What	're	you	talking	about	?
--------------------
SLlCK	:
She	didn	't	like	to	tell	you	herself	,	so	I	'm	doing	it	for	her	.
Yes	,	I	guess	that	's	enough	.
This	is	the	right	thing	to	do	,	Jack	.
With	a	woman	of	her	type	,	this	would	have	happened	sooner	or	later	.
If	you	ask	me	,	I	think	you	're	lucky	.
Maybe	you	are	right	.
Frank	,	get	a	messenger	and	send	that	at	once	,	will	you	?
I	'm	gonna	be	out	of	town	for	three	or	four	weeks	.
In	the	meantime	,	I	'm	out	to	all	callers	.
--------------------
Everybody	,	understand	?
Is	that	message	for	Miss	Tira	,	too	?
Yes	.
But	I	understood	you	were	to	be	married	this	month	.
We	're	both	mistaken	.
FRANK	:
Yes	,	sir	.
[	Singing	]
You	sure	gonna	make	a	gorgeous	bride	.
I	know	I	'm	gonna	make	a	nervous	bride	.
--------------------
I	ain	't	never	done	this	before	.
Marriage	is	a	new	kind	of	racket	for	me	.
I	've	been	married	four	times	.
You	ought	to	do	well	in	the	wholesale	business	.
[	Laughing	]
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
I	don	't	wanna	see	anyone	but	Mr.	Clayton	.
MAlD	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
That	Mr.	Clayton	is	sure	a	wonderful	man	.
--------------------
I	'll	say	he	is	.
I	never	knew	I	could	go	for	anyone	like	I	have	for	him	.
He	made	me	feel	like	a	different	dame	.
I	ain	't	just	a	"	Sister	Honky	Tonk	"	no	more	.
You	're	a	lady	now	.
Thank	you	.
MAlD	:
Some	messenger	gave	me	this	note	to	give	you	,	Miss	Tira	.
Yeah	?
You	can	go	.
--------------------
This	is	Miss	Tira	speaking	.
I	'm	sorry	,	madam	,	Mr.	Clayton	's	gone	away	.
Gone	away	?
When	is	he	expected	back	?
I	couldn	't	say	definitely	but	I	'm	sure	not	for	several	weeks	.
Is	that	the	only	message	he	left	for	me	?
Yes	,	that	's	all	.
Thanks	.
BENNY	:
Hello	,	Tira	darling	.
--------------------
TlRA	:
Benny	.
BENNY	:
How	are	you	?
You	look	so	marvellous	.
Come	right	in	,	sit	right	down	and	make	yourself	at	home	.
BENNY	:
Let	me	look	at	that	beautiful	smile	of	yours	.
TlRA	:
You	know	about	me	getting	married	?
--------------------
BENNY	:
Sure	.
Congratulations	.
Too	late	.
It	's	all	off	.
TlRA	:
Sue	the	guy	for	breach	of	promise	.
BENNY	:
Certainly	.
The	lowlife	.
--------------------
No	,	he	ain	't	,	Benny	.
The	first	guy	I	ever	really	loved	.
I	thought	he	loved	me	,	too	.
What	a	tragedy	.
We	start	proceedings	immediately	.
BENNY	:
How	much	is	he	worth	?
TlRA	:
Millions	.
Millions	?
--------------------
We	sue	him	for	damages	.
I	ain	't	damaged	.
I	just	want	you	to	sue	him	for	breach	of	promise	.
I	got	all	the	proof	you	want	,	letters	,	wires	,	newspaper	stories	,	even	my	trousseau	.
For	that	trousseau	alone	we	collect	plenty	.
It	's	a	cinch	.
When	do	you	want	the	case	tried	?
Let	me	see	.
I	go	on	the	road	with	the	show	and	...
I	'll	be	back	in	a	few	months	.
--------------------
Better	start	then	.
Easy	.
Got	the	case	.
Darling	,	you	give	me	a	few	details	and	I	'll	serve	him	with	papers	right	away	.
Okay	.
First	,	I	'll	tell	you	how	I	met	the	guy	.
But	remember	in	anything	I	say	I	ain	't	got	any	real	animosity	for	him	.
Of	course	.
Lf	I	was	a	home	girl	,	I	'd	be	heartbroken	.
Yes	.
--------------------
Miss	Tira	,	I	understand	you	've	had	a	rather	colourful	past	.
I	gotta	admit	I	've	been	the	love	interest	in	more	than	one	guy	's	life	.
[	Jurors	laughing	]
I	don	't	see	what	my	past	has	got	to	do	with	my	present	.
We	shall	show	that	to	the	satisfaction	of	the	court	,	I	believe	.
Nevertheless	,	the	fact	remains	that	you	've	been	on	...	friendly	terms	with	several	men	.
All	right	,	I	'm	a	sweetheart	of	Sphigma	Psi	,	so	what	?
You	must	answer	questions	directly	,	please	.
Pardon	me	,	Judge	.
Proceed	.
--------------------
Do	you	know	a	man	named	Wiley	...	generally	called	Slick	?
TlRA	:
Yes	,	I	know	the
The	gentleman	.
And	you	recall	the	man	you	see	there	?
If	I	'm	not	mistaken	,	you	mean	that	Dallas	man	.
BOB	:
And	you	are	also	acquainted	,	aren	't	you	,	with	Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	?
Yes	,	I	had	the	pleasure	.
And	no	doubt	you	recall	those	five	gentlemen	...	seated	in	the	first	row	right	inside	the	railing	?
--------------------
Mr.	Foster	,	Mr.	Harris	.
I	do	recall	their	faces	but	them	ain	't	the	names	they	gave	me	.
Pardon	me	again	,	Judge	.
It	's	all	right	.
That	's	all	,	Miss	Tira	.
JUDGE	:
Does	the	plaintiff	's	attorney	wish	any	further	questions	?
I	would	like	to	request	recess	for	about	10	minutes	.
JUDGE	:
Is	that	agreeable	to	the	defence	?
--------------------
BOB	:
Perfectly	.
This	court	's	adjourned	for	10	minutes	.
BENNY	:
Why	did	you	admit	that	you	knew	all	these	men	?
I	do	know	them	.
You	don	't	want	me	to	commit	perjury	?
Yes	,	why	didn	't	you	tell	me	there	was	so	many	men	in	your	life	?
Why	shouldn	't	I	know	guys	?
I	've	been	around	.
--------------------
I	travel	from	coast	to	coast	.
A	dame	like	me	can	't	make	trips	like	that	without	meeting	any	of	the	male	population	.
Listen	to	me	,	Tira	.
You	know	me	,	I	'm	a	smart	lawyer	.
Give	me	that	much	loophole	and	I	'm	through	it	like	an	eel	.
With	what	all	those	guys	,	all	those	riffraffs	,	pardon	me	...	going	up	to	the	judge	and	telling	all	they	know	about	you	and	them	.
It	's	curtains	for	us	.
You	mean	we	're	finished	?
Yeah	,	sure	,	drop	it	.
You	had	enough	publicity	.
--------------------
What	those	guys	are	gonna	tell	the	judge	won	't	read	so	nice	in	the	newspapers	.
I	ain	't	gonna	drop	it	.
Listen	,	Benny	,	have	I	a	right	to	question	witnesses	myself	?
Yeah	,	sure	but	...
That	's	what	I	'm	gonna	do	.
You	don	't	mean	it	.
Now	Mr.	Brown	,	just	tell	the	jury	in	your	words	,	what	took	place	.
I	was	watching	her	dance	and	I	seen	her	looking	at	me	.
I	kind	of	looked	back	and	she	flirted	and	made	a	date	with	me	.
So	,	I	took	her	out	for	a	ride	in	my	car	...	and	she	asked	me	up	to	her	hotel	room	where	she	was	living	.
--------------------
We	had	a	couple	of	drinks	...	and	she	put	on	a	phonograph	record	and	we	danced	.
And	while	we	was	dancing	,	she	kissed	me	.
And	how	long	were	you	with	Miss	Tira	in	her	hotel	room	?
Close	to	a	couple	hours	,	I	should	say	.
That	's	all	,	Mr.	Brown	.
Cross-	examine	.
BENNY	:
My	client	begs	the	permission	of	the	court	...	to	question	the	defence	witness	herself	.
It	's	a	little	unusual	,	but	quite	within	the	plaintiff	's	right	.
JUDGE	:
--------------------
She	may	question	the	witnesses	.
BOB	:
If	you	please	...	the	court	should	warn	the	jury	not	to	be	swayed	...	by	any	theatricalism	by	the	plaintiff	.
JUDGE	:
The	jury	in	weighing	the	evidence	will	bear	in	mind	the	defence	's	warning	.
Lovely	tie	.
Mr.	Brown	,	aren	't	you	the	man	that	had	the	five	wives	?
Yeah	.
And	you	was	married	to	one	when	you	were	with	me	,	wasn	't	you	?
Yes	.
--------------------
Cheating	.
You	made	it	sound	nasty	the	way	you	spoke	about	us	two	...	being	alone	together	in	my	place	.
And	you	know	nothing	happened	that	you	couldn	't	tell	your	grandchildren	about	.
Well	,	I	...
In	other	words	,	it	was	just	a	harmless	little	social	date	,	wasn	't	it	?
Yeah	.
Okay	,	I	'm	through	with	you	.
[	All	laughing	]
How	am	I	doing	?
Any	further	questions	?
--------------------
You	're	excused	,	Mr.	Brown	.
Next	witness	.
Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	.
BAlLIFF	:
Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	,	take	the	stand	.
OFFlCER	:
Quiet	,	please	.
BAlLIFF	:
Do	you	solemnly	swear	to	tell	the	whole	truth	...	and	nothing	but	the	truth	,	so	help	you	God	?
KlRK	:
--------------------
I	do	.
BAlLIFF	:
Take	the	stand	.
BOB	:
Aren	't	you	well-	acquainted	with	the	plaintiff	?
Yes	.
In	fact	,	you	were	intimate	friends	.
Yes	.
Isn	't	it	true	that	you	once	seriously	contemplated	asking	her	to	marry	you	?
Yes	.
--------------------
Now	,	I	understand	that	after	knowing	you	only	a	week	...	the	plaintiff	accepted	several	thousand	dollars	worth	of	gifts	from	you	.
Such	as	a	diamond	bracelet	...
BOB	:
Gowns	,	a	fur	coat
KlRK	:
That	's	correct	.
BOB	:
And	almost	immediately	after	accepting	these	gifts	...	she	became	engaged	to	Mr.	Clayton	,	isn	't	that	so	?
Yes	.
And	after	becoming	engaged	she	refused	to	talk	to	you	,	even	on	the	telephone	.
--------------------
Yes	.
Mr.	Clayton	has	more	money	than	you	have	,	hasn	't	he	?
That	's	true	.
What	construction	did	you	place	upon	this	woman	's	treatment	of	you	?
In	plain	words	,	I	felt	she	simply	played	me	for	a	good	thing	.
BOB	:
Thank	you	,	Mr.	Lawrence	.
Your	witness	.
You	're	not	looking	to	get	those	presents	back	,	are	you	,	Mr.	Lawrence	?
No	,	of	course	not	.
--------------------
I	don	't	expect	you	to	return	them	,	anyway	.
You	're	right	,	I	wouldn	't	.
You	gave	me	those	presents	because	you	liked	me	a	little	,	didn	't	you	?
Yes	.
I	didn	't	ask	you	for	them	,	did	I	?
I	don	't	regret	giving	them	to	you	,	if	that	's	what	you	mean	.
Thanks	,	I	didn	't	think	you	did	.
Now	,	you	was	engaged	to	marry	a	girl	...	just	at	the	time	you	started	running	around	with	me	,	wasn	't	you	?
Yes	.
And	you	know	your	fiancee	came	up	to	me	to	see	me	...	to	ask	me	to	break	it	off	with	you	,	don	't	you	?
--------------------
I	heard	so	.
All	right	,	I	broke	it	off	.
So	what	are	you	crying	about	?
Your	Honour	,	this	sort	of	questioning	is	most	irregular	.
The	plaintiff	,	not	being	a	practicing	attorney	...	may	put	her	questions	as	best	she	can	.
Thanks	,	Judge	,	you	're	regular	.
I	'm	doing	my	best	to	be	legitimate	.
That	's	all	with	you	.
JUDGE	:
Any	further	questions	?
--------------------
BOB	:
Defence	is	ready	for	the	next	witness	.
JUDGE	:
Excused	.
JUDGE	:
Proceed	.
BOB	:
Miss	Beulah	Thorndyke	.
They	had	nerve	enough	to	call	my	own	maid	to	squeal	on	me	?
BOB	:
--------------------
You	are	Miss	Tira	's	personal	maid	,	aren	't	you	?
I	was	,	but	I	ain	't	sure	now	.
BOB	:
As	her	personal	maid	,	it	was	your	duty	to	answer	telephone	calls	...	and	admit	visitors	to	the	apartment	?
Yes	,	ma	'am
Yes	,	sir	.
BOB	:
Miss	Tira	often	had	gentlemen	callers	,	didn	't	she	?
Quite	some	.
BOB	:
--------------------
During	the	time	Miss	Tira	and	Mr.	Clayton	were	engaged	...	did	she	have	other	men	visitors	?
Not	that	I	recall	.
You	have	a	very	convenient	memory	.
That	's	all	.
Cross-	examine	.
TlRA	:
Shadow	,	what	are	you	doing	here	?
BEULAH	:
I	don	't	know	.
They	done	subpoenaed	me	.
--------------------
Beulah	,	tell	the	boys	the	truth	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
After	Mr.	Clayton	and	me	became	engaged	...	did	you	ever	hear	me	talk	about	any	other	man	...	or	did	you	ever	see	me	with	any	other	man	...
outside	of	my	manager	,	Mr.	Barton	?
No	,	ma	'am	.
Did	you	ever	hear	me	make	any	cracks	about	Mr.	Clayton	's	money	?
No	,	ma	'am	.
Did	you	hear	me	talk	about	Mr.	Clayton	?
Oh	,	yes	,	ma	'am	.
What	did	you	hear	me	say	?
--------------------
You	said	...
Just	a	minute	.
Tell	the	jury	.
Is	that	all	right	with	you	,	Judge	?
Yes	.
Proceed	.
You	said	that	you	never	knew	you	could	love	a	man	like	you	love	him	.
I	kind	of	forgot	I	said	that	.
And	you	said	you	had	fallen	so	hard	for	him	that	it	hurt	.
Wait	a	minute	.
--------------------
Answer	one	question	at	a	time	.
I	just	telling	the	truth	like	you	told	me	to	.
Yes	,	but	you	're	telling	too	much	of	it	.
I	ain	't	never	seen	nobody	so	brokenhearted	as	you	was	...	when	you	and	Mr.	Clayton	done	bust	up	.
That	's	enough	,	Beulah	.
You	're	ruining	my	character	.
BOB	:
I	object	,	Your	Honour	.
This	witness	'	testimony	is	entirely	irrelevant	.
I	move	to	strike	it	from	record	.
--------------------
JUDGE	:
Motion	denied	.
JUDGE	:
Any	more	questions	?
BOB	:
No	.
JUDGE	:
You	're	excused	.
Next	witness	.
Call	Mr.	Slick	Wiley	to	the	stand	.
--------------------
BAlLIFF	:
Mr.	Wiley	,	Mr.	Slick	Wiley	,	please	take	the	stand	.
Bob	,	do	you	have	to	question	this	man	?
Of	course	,	Jack	.
He	'll	win	our	case	for	us	.
She	can	't	laugh	him	off	.
Don	't	mention	the	night	I	found	him	at	her	apartment	.
I	've	got	to	ask	him	about	that	.
BOB	:
That	's	what	I	'm	depending	on	.
--------------------
JACK	:
I	don	't	want	you	to	mention	it	.
All	right	,	I	'll	keep	it	as	clean	as	I	can	.
When	he	gets	through	with	Slick	,	we	haven	't	got	a	chance	.
Mr.	Wiley	,	you	know	the	plaintiff	,	Miss	Tira	,	very	well	,	do	you	not	?
Sure	,	we	've	been	like	that	.
During	the	time	...	the	plaintiff	was	engaged	to	the	defendant	,	Mr.	Clayton	...	were	you	friendly	with	her	?
Never	better	.
Isn	't	it	true	the	plaintiff	used	to	give	you	sums	of	money	at	times	for	your	own	use	?
Yeah	,	sure	.
--------------------
She	was	always	a	good	for	anywhere	from	$10	to	a	C-	note	.
Isn	't	it	also	a	fact	...	that	you	kept	personal	belongings	in	the	plaintiff	's	apartment	?
SLlCK	:
You	mean	in	pyjamas	?
BOB	:
Yes	.
Yeah	,	I	always	kept	two	pair	there	.
Silk	ones	.
One	green	and	one	purple	with	yellow	stripes	.
[	All	laughing	]
--------------------
[	Judge	knocks	gavel	]
Mr.	Wiley	,	did	the	plaintiff	ever	suggest	to	you	...	her	interest	in	the	defendant	was	principally	because	of	his	wealth	?
Yeah	,	sure	.
SLlCK	:
She	always	looked	to	hook	some	guy	with	a	lot	of	dough	.
That	's	all	,	Mr.	Wiley	.
Cross-	examine	.
TlRA	:
Where	were	you	on	the	night	of	June	7	?
I	don	't	remember	.
--------------------
All	right	,	I	'll	give	you	a	choice	,	where	were	you	any	night	last	June	,	July	,	or	August	?
Come	on	,	make	up	your	mind	.
In	stir	.
That	's	it	,	speak	up	so	they	can	hear	you	.
He	was	in	stir	.
That	means	,	in	other	words	,	gentlemen	of	the	jury	,	he	was	in	jail	.
Tell	the	gentlemen	how	many	other	jails	you	been	in	the	last	10	years	.
I	don	't	remember	.
TlRA	:
He	can	't	remember	.
--------------------
You	forgot	to	tell	these	good	people	...	the	only	time	I	gave	you	money	was	when	you	got	out	of	jail	...	you	were	broke	,	and	walking	on	your	heels	.
You	heel	.
As	for	you	sitting	in	my	apartment	in	silk	pyjamas	...	you	never	sat	around	my	apartment	in	nothing	.
And	you	know	it	.
Answer	me	,	did	you	?
Sure	,	I	did	.
And	I	was	seen	there	,	too	.
Why	you
You	perjurer	.
I	object	to	the	witness	being	harassed	this	way	.
--------------------
Who	's	harassing	who	?
I	'm	just	asking	for	a	square	deal	,	that	's	all	.
I	'm	asking	good	,	honest	,	and	intelligent	people	not	to	take	...	the	word	of	an	ex-	convict	against	a	good	,	honest	and	innocent	woman	.
I	object	,	Your	Honour	.
JUDGE	:
Objection	overruled	.
TlRA	:
You	're	right	,	Judge	.
[	All	laughing	]
There	you	are	.
--------------------
She	's	got	the	jury	and	the	judge	under	her	arm	.
They	'll	hand	her	the	case	on	a	silver	platter	.
Don	't	be	unfair	.
Unfair	?
You	've	got	so	much	money	,	you	don	't	mind	losing	this	case	.
But	my	reputation	means	something	to	me	.
If	ever	there	was	a	case	I	wanted	to	win	,	this	is	it	.
I	told	you	not	to	put	the	man	on	the	stand	in	the	first	place	.
You	'll	have	to	take	stand	and	tell	your	story	.
I	'll	do	nothing	of	the	kind	.
--------------------
If	you	feel	that	way	about	it	,	why	did	you	contest	the	case	at	all	?
I	'm	sorry	I	did	.
If	any	right-	thinking	man	will	believe	what	a	crook	and	a	jailbird	will	say	...	then	there	's	nothing	I	could	say	that	'll	make	any	difference	.
I	'm	through	with	this	guy	,	Judge	.
Do	you	wish	to	question	the	witness	further	?
Yes	.
I	have	a	few	questions	I	should	like	to	ask	.
Mr.	Wiley	...
Stop	.
Sit	down	.
--------------------
That	's	enough	.
Call	it	off	.
I	'll	settle	for	the	amount	asked	.
You	're	absolutely	mad	.
I	don	't	want	it	to	go	any	further	,	do	you	understand	?
All	right	,	have	it	your	own	way	.
If	you	want	to	make	a	fool	of	yourself	over	this	woman	,	I	can	't	stop	you	.
Don	't	try	to	.
BOB	:
Your	Honour	...	my	client	has	requested	me	,	for	some	peculiar	reason	of	his	own	...	to	cease	contest	of	this	suit	.
--------------------
He	's	prepared	to	settle	for	the	full	amount	of	the	case	.
JUDGE	:
How	extraordinary	.
BOB	:
I	'll	say	it	is	.
What	is	this	,	Benny	?
Don	't	ask	me	,	I	'm	paralysed	.
Sounds	like	a	trick	.
Does	the	plaintiff	accept	this	motion	as	satisfaction	of	this	suit	?
Okay	,	the	plaintiff	accepts	it	with	pleasure	.
--------------------
JUDGE	:
In	view	of	the	agreement	between	the	parties	...	the	jury	is	discharged	with	thanks	.
Case	dismissed	.
Court	's	adjourned	.
JUROR	1	:
I	'm	glad	you	won	your	case	,	Miss	Tira	.
JUROR	2	:
That	's	our	pleasure	.
Wait	a	minute	.
Boys	,	now	,	take	it	easy	.
--------------------
I	'll	give	you	all	the	breaks	in	the	world	but	don	't	crowd	.
Pictures	first	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	1	:
Miss	Tira	,	would	you	stand	up	?
Of	course	,	if	it	'll	make	you	happy	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	2	:
Look	this	way	,	please	.
Wait	a	minute	boys	,	one	at	a	time	.
I	'm	not	twins	.
[	All	laughing	]
--------------------
PHOTOGRAPHER	3	:
Hold	that	pose	,	please	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	3	:
That	's	it	.
All	right	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	4	:
Hold	for	me	,	please	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	4	:
Thank	you	.
Will	you	answer	a	few	questions	,	Miss	Tira	?
--------------------
Of	course	.
You	've	won	the	case	.
What	do	you	intend	to	do	?
Carry	on	the	same	as	before	.
Why	did	you	admit	knowing	so	many	men	in	your	life	?
It	's	not	the	men	in	your	life	that	counts	,	it	's	the	life	in	your	men	.
REPORTER	:
Do	you	feel	you	've	done	right	?
TlRA	:
Show	me	a	woman	who	can	do	better	.
--------------------
You	were	right	,	Judge	.
It	was	nice	of	you	to	come	up	.
Thank	you	.
You	've	been	charming	,	my	dear	.
Very	charming	.
I	'm	glad	you	found	that	out	.
Of	course	.
Well	,	goodbye	.
I	see	you	've	that	hand	trouble	,	too	,	huh	?
Goodbye	again	.
--------------------
Goodbye	.
[	Telephone	ringing	]
Hello	?
Juror	Number	4	.
Yes	,	I	remember	you	.
You	were	the	one	with	the	nice	,	kind	face	.
I	know	you	were	for	me	.
I	wanna	thank	you	for	those	beautiful	flowers	.
They	were	lovely	.
And	don	't	forget	,	come	up	and	see	me	sometime	.
--------------------
BEULAH	:
Mr.	Clayton	,	how	is	you	?
Yes	.
All	right	,	goodbye	.
You	said	things	in	the	courtroom	that	led	me	to	believe	you	loved	me	.
That	you	still	love	me	.
Did	you	mean	them	?
What	difference	does	it	make	now	?
All	the	difference	in	the	world	.
You	didn	't	believe	me	before	.
--------------------
Because	I	didn	't	understand	about	Slick	being	up	here	that	night	.
So	that	's	it	.
I	didn	't	understand	it	myself	till	I	found	out	it	was	all	a	big	frame-	up	.
To	keep	me	from	leaving	the	show	.
Then	let	's	forget	the	whole	thing	and	go	on	together	.
You	sure	you	want	it	that	way	?
You	know	I	do	.
Sit	down	.
You	're	everything	to	me	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
Beulah	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Bring	me	my	jewel	case	.
You	're	more	fascinating	than	ever	.
I	get	better	as	I	go	along	.
BEULAH	:
Here	,	Miss	Tira	.
Got	something	for	you	.
I	'm	glad	to	know	it	wasn	't	the	money	you	wanted	.
--------------------
You	got	a	lot	of	other	things	it	takes	to	make	a	woman	happy	.
[	Jazzy	instrumental	music	]
JACK	:
I	'm	crazy	about	you	.
I	did	my	best	to	make	you	that	way	.
Look	,	darling	,	you	need	a	rest	,	and	so	do	I.
Let	me	take	you	away	somewhere	.
Would	you	call	that	a	rest	?
What	are	you	thinking	about	?

Look	at	them	.
And	that	,	folks	,	is	only	a	sample	of	what	you	're	gonna	see	for	the	one	price	.
Now	look	,	folks	,	you	've	got	to	give	me	your	undivided	attention	...	because	I	want	you	to	hear	each	and	every	word	that	I	'm	going	to	say	.

No	,	I	'm	gonna	be	a	bad	girl	and	go	home	to	bed	.
No	.

So	what	?
Hello	,	honey	.
I	've	just	been	working	on	you	.
Oh	,	yeah	?
What	have	you	got	to	tell	me	tonight	?
I	have	your	horoscope	.
I	hope	you	got	some	good	news	in	it	.
--------------------
Good	and	bad	.
Go	ahead	,	I	got	my	fingers	crossed	.
You	were	born	in	August	.
Yes	,	one	of	the	hot	months	.
It	was	on	the	17th	...	under	the	sign	of	Leo	,	the	lion	.

You	are	very	wise	.
I	profit	by	my	experience	.
Now	listen	,	honey	,	you	just	tell	me	about	my	future	.
You	see	,	I	know	all	about	my	past	.
You	have	a	wonderful	future	.
I	see	a	man	in	your	life	.
What	,	only	one	?
But	this	is	one	very	particular	man	.

He	is	very	wealthy	.
Enormously	wealthy	.
You	mean	a	millionaire	.
What	does	he	look	like	?

What	,	a	change	of	men	?
RAJAH	:
Not	yet	.
Sitting	or	reclining	?
But	it	's	all	left	me	.
I	can	't	help	you	anymore	tonight	.
I	can	't	.
Thanks	,	Rajah	.
It	's	all	right	,	I	'm	in	a	hurry	anyway	.
--------------------
Give	me	my	thing	.
Horoscope	.
Keep	this	where	you	may	consult	it	frequently	.
All	right	,	I	'll	take	it	to	bed	with	me	.
What	are	you	playing	me	the	chill	for	all	of	a	sudden	,	baby	?
Because	I	ain	't	exactly	in	the	mood	.
Seems	like	I	can	't	put	you	in	the	mood	,	lately	.
I	guess	you	're	right	.
SLlCK	:
Barton	wants	you	to	get	in	the	cage	and	wrestle	them	lions	tonight	.
--------------------
Not	tonight	.
I	told	Barton	.
Tira	,	you	've	got	to	.
The	show	is	walking	on	its	heels	in	this	town	.
What	's	the	rush	?
You	seem	awful	anxious	to	get	somewhere	.
Pulling	something	funny	,	if	you	ask	me	.
I	ain	't	asking	you	.
SLlCK	:
I	'm	asking	you	.
--------------------
What	do	you	want	to	stay	in	a	hotel	in	town	for	?
Why	don	't	you	stay	on	the	lot	,	same	as	the	rest	of	us	?
'	Cause	I	ain	't	the	same	as	the	rest	of	you	.
I	'm	sick	of	people	worrying	about	what	I	do	.
I	get	about	as	much	privacy	around	here	as	a	goldfish	.
Getting	high	hat	,	huh	?
What	did	you	do	?
Got	you	a	haircut	or	have	your	ears	moved	down	?
It	's	a	wonder	you	noticed	.
OTTO	:
--------------------
Miss	Tira	.
TlRA	:
Come	in	,	honey	.
A	gentleman	gave	me	this	note	for	you	.
What	's	your	name	?
My	name	is	Frederick	,	but	they	calls	me	Otto	.
All	right	,	honey	,	you	tell	the	gentleman	it	's	okay	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Who	's	the	boyfriend	?
Wouldn	't	you	like	to	know	?
--------------------
I	tell	you	,	you	go	mixing	up	with	any	guy	and	I	'll	bust	his	jaw	.
I	'll	break	him	in	two	,	you	hear	?
I	'll	give	him	the	works	.
If	you	ain	't	careful	,	you	're	liable	to	hurt	somebody	.
SLlCK	:
Take	that	as	a	warning	.
You	take	it	and	bury	it	,	maybe	it	will	grow	lilies	.
I	'll	see	you	later	.
The	later	,	the	better	.
GlRL	:
--------------------
Tira	,	can	I	come	in	?
TlRA	:
Come	on	in	.
See	,	I	just	felt	I	had	to	talk	to	somebody	.
I	'm	in	a	rush	,	but	go	ahead	and	talk	.
You	look	terrible	.
What	's	the	matter	?
Everything	is	the	matter	,	with	me	anyhow	.
Barton	again	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
That	guy	is	a	habit	with	you	,	honey	.
Why	don	't	you	step	out	?
A	change	will	do	you	good	.
That	's	what	I	'm	doing	.
What	about	Slick	?
He	's	all	right	.
If	he	kept	his	hands	out	of	other	people	's	pockets	.
What	is	it	gonna	get	me	hanging	around	him	?
I	got	ideas	.
Somewhere	there	's	a	guy	with	a	million	waiting	for	a	dame	like	me	.
--------------------
Rajah	said	so	.
Tira	,	you	always	have	such	swell	things	.
How	do	you	do	it	on	your	salary	?
It	's	a	gift	,	honey	.
GlRL	:
Them	beads	is	pretty	.
TlRA	:
They	are	kind	of	pretty	.
He	gave	me	them	.
Genuine	amber	.
--------------------
The	beads	,	I	mean	.
And	these	here	handkerchiefs	,	genuine	Madeira	.
TlRA	:
No	,	he	gave	me	the	pillows	.
TlRA	:
Here	,	here	's	the	baby	.
He	gave	me	them	.
And	this	here	sailor	,	he	gave	me	this	here	jade	set	...	he	got	in	Shanghai	,	genuine	jade	,	he	said	.
Here	.
Tira	,	they	're	beautiful	.
--------------------
You	like	them	?
Yes	.
Try	them	on	.
If	they	do	something	to	you	,	you	can	have	them	.
GlRL	:
Thanks	.
TlRA	:
Don	't	mention	it	.
I	'd	like	to	stick	around	and	show	you	the	rest	of	my	stuff	,	but	I	got	a	heavy	date	.
I	gotta	be	leaving	you	.
--------------------
Tira	,	how	can	I	ever	thank	you	?
Don	't	.
Why	,	you	look	better	already	.
Say	,	you	're	a	good-	looking	dame	.
There	is	a	lot	of	guys	that	would	go	for	you	in	a	big	way	.
Always	remember	,	honey	,	a	good	motto	is	:
"	Take	all	you	can	get	and	give	as	little	as	possible	.	"
Don	't	forget	,	honey	,	never	let	one	man	worry	your	mind	.
TlRA	:
Find	them	,	fool	them	,	forget	them	.
--------------------
GlRL	:
Thanks	again	.
TlRA	:
Hello	,	how	's	the	joints	tonight	?
ACROBAT	1	:
Fine	.
ACROBAT	2	:
Swell	,	Tira	.
HARRY	:
Hello	,	Tira	.
--------------------
This	is	the	first	chance	I	've	had	to	talk	to	you	.
When	are	we	going	out	again	together	?
Almost	anytime	you	say	,	Harry	.
I	got	to	see	you	more	often	.
You	know	,	I	'm	kind	of	crazy	about	you	.
Oh	,	yeah	?
Can	't	get	you	out	of	my	mind	.
That	's	bad	.
Better	not	be	thinking	about	me	when	you	're	up	there	in	the	flying	rings	.
Something	's	liable	to	happen	.
--------------------
Not	a	chance	.
How	about	us	going	somewhere	after	the	show	tonight	?
Not	tonight	,	I	gotta	see	my	aunt	.
ACROBAT	3	:
Tira	,	us	fellows	are	worried	about	Harry	here	.
He	don	't	eat	enough	,	won	't	even	sleep	enough	.
Love	,	you	know	,	is	bad	for	an	acrobat	.
Don	't	worry	.
I	ain	't	gonna	hurt	him	.
I	only	wanna	feel	his	muscles	.
--------------------
Bye	,	Harry	.
ERNEST	:
I	never	met	anybody	just	like	you	before	.
You	're	different	.
TlRA	:
Anything	different	always	costs	more	but	it	's	worth	it	.
By	the	way	,	you	married	or	single	?
ERNEST	:
Married	five	times	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
Five	times	.
Wedding	bells	must	sound	like	an	alarm	clock	to	you	.
ERNEST	:
I	don	't	'	suppose	you	believe	in	marriage	,	do	you	?
Only	as	a	last	resort	.
What	do	you	do	for	a	living	?
I	'm	sort	of	a	politician	.
I	don	't	like	work	,	either	.
[	Ernest	chuckling	]
I	like	to	get	around	and	travel	.
--------------------
Believe	me	,	I	've	been	places	and	seen	things	.
I	've	been	things	and	seen	places	.
That	sort	of	evens	us	up	,	eh	?
[	Tira	murmurs	seductively	]
Sit	down	.
I	didn	't	get	your	name	.
ERNEST	:
I	don	't	give	my	name	to	everybody	,	but	it	's	...
TlRA	:
Don	't	tell	me	it	's	Smith	.
--------------------
ERNEST	:
No	.
Brown	.
Ernest	Brown	.
That	will	do	.
TlRA	:
What	colour	are	you	eyes	?
ERNEST	:
I	don	't	know	.
ERNEST	:
--------------------
You	like	them	?
TlRA	:
Lovely	.
Where	did	you	say	you	are	from	?
ERNEST	:
Don	't	think	I	've	said	,	but	I	'm	from	Dallas	,	Texas	.
Dallas	,	huh	?
I	see	.
Pardon	me	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
Dallas	,	huh	?
There	we	are	.
Dallas	,	huh	?
[	Light	music	playing	]
TlRA	:
[	Singing	on	record	]
Bet	your	life	no	one	loves	you	like	that	Dallas	man	.
TlRA	:
[	Singing	]
Oh	,	yeah	?
--------------------
TlRA	:
[	Singing	]
[	Light	music	continues	playing	]
You	just	put	your	heart	and	soul	in	your	dancing	,	don	't	you	,	honey	?
[	Tira	laughing	]
You	've	certainly	given	me	the	time	of	my	life	,	baby	.
Don	't	say	"	given	,	"	I	don	't	like	that	word	"	given	.	"
Do	pretty	well	for	yourself	,	don	't	you	?
That	's	nothing	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
Ever	take	a	crack	at	show	business	?
ERNEST	:
That	's	one	business	I	never	tried	.
TlRA	:
You	ought	to	do	great	in	that	racket	.
TlRA	:
In	front	of	the	tent	,	the	big	boss	.
ERNEST	:
You	mean	with	a	cigar	?
You	catch	on	.
--------------------
Maybe	I	can	fix	it	up	with	Mr.	Barton	to	sell	you	an	interest	in	the	show	.
Then	I	can	take	the	leading	lady	out	all	the	time	,	huh	?
That	's	the	angle	.
We	'll	talk	that	over	later	.
Remember	your	five	wives	.
You	're	the	baby	that	can	make	me	forget	them	.
Kiss	Papa	.
Give	me	a	long	one	.
You	ain	't	the	only	girl	I	've	ever	kissed	.
You	got	a	lot	to	learn	even	at	that	.
--------------------
TlRA	:
What	do	you	mean	by	busting	in	here	like	this	?
What	are	you	doing	here	with	my	wife	?
ERNEST	:
Your	wife	?
TlRA	:
He	's	lying	,	I	ain	't	his	wife	.
You	can	't	get	away	with	this	.
Listen	,	you	're	in	a	tough	spot	.
ERNEST	:
--------------------
Wait	,	let	me	get	this	straight	.
TlRA	:
You	got	it	straight	.
It	's	gonna	be	just	too	bad	for	you	when	I	call	the	cops	.
[	Light	music	continues	playing	]
You	can	't	shake	this	guy	down	.
Here	I	am	about	to	promote	him	for	dough	,	you	come	in	to	spoil	it	.
Don	't	give	me	that	.
I	get	it	.
You	all	don	't	have	to	talk	it	over	.
--------------------
I	reckon	I	'm	leaving	right	now	.
No	,	you	ain	't	.
There	's	a	business	matter	to	settle	first	.
ERNEST	:
I	won	't	give	you	a	nickel	.
ERNEST	:
You	picked	the	wrong	one	.
I	got	connections	in	this	town	.
ERNEST	:
I	'll	see	that	you	get	what	's	coming	to	you	.
--------------------
Now	wait	a	minute	.
[	Ernest	grunts	and	falls	]
I	've	laid	out	bigger	chumps	than	you	,	you	mug	.
Now	try	and	get	out	of	this	.
You	're	in	it	with	me	.
As	fast	as	you	pick	them	up	,	I	'll	drop	them	.
Yeah	?
He	ain	't	doing	so	good	.
You	better	look	him	over	.
I	think	he	's	croaked	.
--------------------
Ain	't	that	nice	.
I	told	you	them	barroom	tricks	of	yours	will	get	us	in	trouble	.
Come	on	,	we	gotta	lam	.
What	?
Leave	him	here	in	my	place	for	the	cops	to	find	?
I	ain	't	taking	any	rap	for	something	you	've	done	.
You	like	me	to	get	sent	up	,	so	you	can	have	a	free	hand	with	the	boys	.
What	a	good	time	you	'd	have	.
Listen	,	you	may	be	tired	of	me	,	but	I	ain	't	tired	of	you	.
There	ain	't	no	time	for	that	now	.
--------------------
Get	him	out	of	here	.
Where	am	I	gonna	put	a	stiff	in	this	joint	?
Put	him	out	in	the	hall	.
They	can	't	tell	who	did	it	then	.
Hey	,	lay	off	.
Ain	't	you	got	no	respect	for	the	dead	?
Come	on	,	let	's	blow	.
WOMAN	:
Is	he	dead	?
OFFlCER	1	:
--------------------
He	's	coming	around	.
Got	a	crack	on	his	head	.
MAN	:
Wonder	how	.
Did	you	people	hear	any	noise	?
Sure	,	I	heard	a	phonograph	playing	.
That	's	it	.
Take	it	easy	,	partner	.
Got	any	idea	who	did	this	?
It	's	one	of	them	circus	fellows	.
--------------------
Pick	him	out	?
Sure	I	can	pick	him	.
Say	,	I	've	been	robbed	!
Are	you	sure	?
I	had	a	diamond	that	big	in	a	ring	on	my	finger	.
We	'll	get	some	of	the	boys	to	pick	him	up	if	he	ain	't	left	town	.
Can	you	make	the	grade	?
Sure	.
OFFlCER	1	:
Right	this	way	.
--------------------
OFFlCER	1	:
That	's	him	.
OFFlCER	2	:
Through	the	tent	.
OFFlCER	2	:
Move	,	boys	.
OFFlCER	1	:
That	's	him	.
You	're	not	going	to	pull	that	on	me	.
SLlCK	:
--------------------
Help	!
OFFlCER	2	:
None	of	that	.
Don	't	start	no	riot	.
That	's	him	.
Go	ahead	,	frisk	him	.
Come	on	.
ERNEST	:
That	's	it	.
OFFlCER	1	:
--------------------
You	sure	?
ERNEST	:
I	can	prove	it	.
OFFlCER	1	:
Take	him	along	.
But	it	's	mine	.
It	's	evidence	,	give	it	here	.
Come	on	.
Our	phone	working	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
Thanks	.
Hello	.
Give	me	long	distance	.
Long	distance	?
Ain	't	you	never	heard	of	it	?
Anything	wrong	?
Cops	picked	up	Slick	for	knocking	over	a	guy	and	lifting	his	diamond	ring	.
BlG	BlLL	:
He	pulled	that	job	here	?
TlRA	:
--------------------
Don	't	worry	.
You	're	safe	.
It	's	me	that	they	...
Hello	.
Long	distance	?
I	want	to	talk	to	Benny	Pinkowitz	.
New	York	City	.
I	don	't	know	.
He	lives	around	88th	Street	and	Riverside	Drive	.
Pinkowitz	.
--------------------
Pinkowitz	,	I	said	.
All	right	,	I	'll	spell	it	for	you	.
"	P	"	like	in	pansy	.
I-	N-	K-	O-	W	...
"	W	"	like	in	witch	.
No	,	witch	!
Dame	misunderstood	me	.
I-	T	...
"	T	"	like	in	tomato	.
"	Z.	"
--------------------
Put	them	all	together	,	they	spell	"	Pinkowitz	.	"
All	right	,	you	'll	ring	me	?
Okay	.
Why	are	you	calling	that	shyster	?
He	helped	me	beat	one	rap	,	and	he	can	do	it	again	.
How	're	you	mixed	up	in	this	?
Like	an	olive	in	a	martini	.
[	Telephone	ringing	]
Hello	.
[	Telephone	ringing	]
--------------------
That	's	service	.
Hello	,	Benny	?
Benny	,	this	is	Tira	.
Hello	,	Tira	.
It	's	all	right	.
You	didn	't	disturb	me	.
What	is	this	time	?
Can	that	be	the	truth	?
[	Murmurs	in	disbelief	]
All	right	,	I	'll	catch	the	first	train	out	.
--------------------
Maybe	for	you	,	Tira	,	I	can	do	something	.
But	as	for	Slick	,	I	ain	't	so	sure	.
Say	,	have	you	got	any	money	?
It	will	take	a	nice	piece	of	change	to	square	up	everything	.
About	myself	,	I	ain	't	asking	a	nickel	.
Don	't	worry	,	Benny	.
I	'll	have	the	money	when	you	get	here	.
Only	work	fast	.
Leave	it	to	me	.
Goodbye	.
--------------------
See	you	later	.
BENNY	:
Hey	,	operator	,	listen	...
I	don	't	accept	reverse	charges	.
Yeah	.
Bill	,	you	gotta	let	me	have	some	dough	.
You	're	asking	favours	of	me	now	?
All	right	,	you	win	.
Give	me	a	light	.
If	you	'd	been	nicer	to	me	and	worked	the	way	I	wanted	you	to	...	why	then	...
--------------------
It	's	either	one	thing	or	the	other	.
You	fix	me	up	with	dough	or	I	gotta	get	out	of	town	.
If	Slick	goes	up	,	he	's	gonna	drag	me	with	him	.
I	'm	willing	to	do	my	share	,	more	than	my	share	.
I	'll	work	them	cats	like	they	've	never	been	worked	.
If	it	'll	make	you	happy	,	I	'll	even	stick	my	head	in	the	big	cat	's	mouth	.
Think	it	over	.
She	'll	stick	her	head	in	the	big	cat	's	mouth	?
This	is	big	.
If	she	'll	do	that	,	your	fortune	's	as	good	as	made	.
--------------------
The	Big	Show	would	grab	that	act	in	a	minute	.
They	've	been	all	season	looking	for	an	attraction	like	that	.
They	've	been	wanting	something	big	.
This	is	it	.
Can	't	you	see	it	?
The	24	sheets	,	"	Dame	Sticks	Her	Beautiful	Head	in	a	Lion	's	Mouth	.	"
The	jaws	of	death	!
I	mean	,	it	's	stupendous	!
Tell	them	we	can	handle	them	cats	like	nobody	else	.
FLEA	:

She	's	safer	in	that	cage	than	in	bed	.
BlG	BlLL	:
I	don	't	doubt	it	.
Tira	,	I	've	changed	my	mind	.
Does	it	work	any	better	?
I	've	got	your	money	.
It	's	a	drop	in	the	bucket	to	what	you	'll	get	.
There	is	a	Santa	Claus	,	but	why	the	great	joy	?
We	can	sell	the	act	to	the	Big	Show	.
That	was	a	great	idea	you	got	.
--------------------
What	idea	was	that	?
Sticking	your	head	in	the	lion	's	mouth	!
Who	's	sticking	whose	head	in	whose	mouth	?
FLEA	:
You	!
It	's	marvellous	,	it	's	stupendous	!

You	can	't	back	out	on	me	.

What	do	you	think	I	am	,	screwy	?
Sticking	my	head	in	a	lion	's	mouth	.
Don	't	make	me	laugh	,	I	ain	't	in	the	mood	.
He	'll	let	you	stick	your	hand	in	,	why	not	your	head	?
You	're	crazy	if	you	don	't	grab	this	chance	.
It	means	a	fortune	.

What	good	will	clothes	do	me	without	a	head	?
It	's	a	cinch	for	you	,	Tira	.

The	only	trouble	with	a	trick	like	that	...	if	it	don	't	work	the	first	time	,	you	don	't	get	a	second	chance	.
How	much	dough	you	got	?

I	may	need	more	later	.

Come	on	,	talk	to	me	.
TlRA	:
Come	on	,	get	up	.
Come	on	,	speak	up	for	yourself	.
--------------------
TlRA	:
What	's	the	matter	with	you	?
You	gotta	be	sitting	?
Get	up	.
TlRA	:
Yeah	,	you	'll	end	up	as	a	rug	.
Come	on	,	you	're	holding	up	the	works	,	you	mug	.
Give	us	a	peek	.
Romeo	,	what	's	the	matter	with	you	?
Come	on	,	get	up	there	,	that	's	it	.
--------------------
[	Fast-	paced	instrumental	music	continues	playing	]
And	now	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	...	for	the	first	time	since	Nero	threw	the	Christians	to	the	lions	...	you	will	see	feminine	beauty	,	triumphant	and	unafraid	.
Miss	Tira	will	defy	death	by	placing	her	head	...	in	the	jaws	of	the	king	of	beasts	.
Miss	Tira	!
[	Fanfare	playing	]
[	Lion	growling	]
If	them	lions	don	't	show	some	sense	,	I	'm	going	down	and	bite	her	myself	.
Come	on	,	handsome	,	say	,	"	Ah	.	"
Come	on	,	big	guy	.
That	's	it	.
--------------------
Remember	my	contract	,	baby	.
[	Fanfare	playing	]
That	was	great	,	wasn	't	it	?
I	didn	't	see	anything	great	about	it	.
Look	here	,	I	happen	to	know	her	publicity	man	.
How	would	you	all	like	to	go	back	...
I	'm	for	that	.
Oh	,	no	.
Let	's	do	,	Alicia	.
We	don	't	care	about	seeing	the	rest	of	the	show	,	do	we	?
--------------------
No	.
And	it	'll	be	a	lot	of	fun	knowing	her	.
It	's	absurd	to	make	such	a	fuss	over	an	ordinary	circus	performer	.
Are	we	going	,	or	aren	't	we	?
We	certainly	are	.
Well	,	let	's	go	.
Very	well	.
I	suppose	I	must	bow	before	the	general	enthusiasm	.
Beulah	,	that	's	another	performance	under	my	belt	and	I	still	got	the	face	.
Bless	you	,	child	,	I	hopes	you	always	keeps	it	.
--------------------
It	's	my	fortune	.
When	I	was	born	with	this	face	,	it	was	the	same	as	striking	oil	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Beulah	laughing	]
You	sure	do	believe	in	that	horoscope	,	don	't	you	,	Miss	Tira	?
It	tells	me	everything	.
I	wouldn	't	make	a	move	without	it	.
Yes	,	indeed	,	Tira	enjoys	meeting	people	.
You	'll	find	her	a	regular	fellow	.
She	has	to	be	in	the	mood	.
--------------------
That	is	,	her	work	is	very	strenuous	and	stars	will	be	temperamental	at	times	.
Yes	,	so	I	've	heard	.
Yes	.
Excuse	me	just	a	moment	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
See	who	that	is	.
BEULAH	:
Evening	,	Mr.	Madigan	.
FLEA	:
May	I	see	Miss	Tira	,	please	?
--------------------
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	sir	.
TlRA	:
Come	in	,	Flea	.
Are	you	in	the	mood	?
For	what	?
Silk	hats	.
I	can	get	that	way	.
FLEA	:
Okay	,	Beulah	.
--------------------
FLEA	:
Step	right	in	,	please	.
KlRK	:
Thank	you	.
FLEA	:
Just	make	yourself	right	at	home	.
Miss	Tira	'll	be	out	directly	.
KlRK	:
That	's	nice	.
Appreciate	it	.
--------------------
MR.	BOND	:
Thank	you	.
Mr.	And	Mrs.	Fletcher	,	Mr.	And	Mrs.	Bond	.
MRS.	BOND	:
How	do	you	do	?
FLEA	:
Mr.	Lawrence	and	Miss	Hatton	.
Pleased	to	meet	you	,	won	't	you	sit	down	?
MRS.	BOND	:
Thank	you	.
--------------------
Won	't	you	sit	down	?
If	you	don	't	mind	,	I	'd	rather	wait	in	the	lounge	.
Pleased	to	have	met	you	,	anyway	.
Now	,	let	's	see	,	where	were	we	?
I	was	about	to	say	,	we	really	came	back	to	tell	you	what	a	thrill	you	gave	us	.
Thank	you	,	I	'm	glad	you	liked	my	act	.
It	is	kind	of	unusual	.
I	don	't	see	how	you	get	up	enough	courage	to	thrust	your	head	in	that	beast	's	mouth	.
I	often	wonder	myself	.
It	seems	terribly	dangerous	.
--------------------
It	is	,	that	's	why	I	have	to	carry	a	rod	,	I	mean	a	gun	.
I	had	to	shoot	a	lion	once	.
Really	,	was	he	mad	?
He	wasn	't	exactly	pleased	about	it	.
Would	you	be	so	good	as	to	autograph	my	programme	?
Love	to	.
MRS.	BOND	:
I	should	think	you	dread	every	new	performance	.
It	is	kind	of	wearing	on	the	nerves	.
Of	course	,	I	don	't	intend	to	do	this	all	my	life	.
--------------------
Thanks	.
And	mine	?
[	Tira	murmurs	in	agreement	]
I	don	't	believe	after	all	this	excitement	,	that	you	'd	enjoy	being	idle	.
I	'll	be	doing	something	.
Say	,	I	've	got	a	great	idea	.
Why	don	't	you	have	supper	with	us	?
MR.	BOND	:
We	'd	love	to	have	you	.
Thanks	,	but	I	've	previous	engagements	.
--------------------
That	's	too	bad	.
It	's	been	such	a	great	pleasure	to	meet	you	.
Thank	you	.
Permit	me	to	say	,	I	think	you	're	perfectly	wonderful	.
Coming	from	a	woman	,	that	's	a	big	compliment	.
MR.	BOND	:
Delighted	.
It	's	been	charming	to	meet	you	lovely	people	.
MR.	FLETCHER	:
Have	a	lovely	evening	.
--------------------
TlRA	:
Good	night	.
Anyway	,	you	've	been	awfully	kind	.
I	'll	never	forget	you	.
No	one	ever	does	.
Good	night	.
Good	night	.
FLEA	:
Swell	person	,	isn	't	she	?
I	'm	so	glad	we	met	her	.
--------------------
How	about	taking	a	look	at	the	lion	she	works	with	?
MR.	FLETCHER	:
Good	idea	.
MRS.	FLETCHER	:
We	'll	wait	for	Alicia	.
MRS.	BOND	:
Yes	.
We	'll	join	you	later	.
MR.	BOND	:
Until	then	.
--------------------
FLEA	:
Don	't	be	long	.
MRS.	BOND	:
All	right	.
Beulah	,	remind	me	to	tell	Flea	Madigan	to	get	that	blue	book	in	here	...	with	the	400	in	it	.
So	I	'll	know	who	's	who	and	what	's	what	in	this	town	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Mr.	Lawrence	,	huh	?
Did	you	have	a	nice	visit	with	your	lion	tamer	?
Alicia	,	she	's	marvellous	.
--------------------
You	really	should	've	stayed	.
Such	good	fun	.
Nonsense	.
I	can	't	see	why	everybody	's	so	absolutely	gaga	about	her	.
MRS.	FLETCHER	:
Not	at	all	.
ALlCIA	:
Of	course	,	she	would	impress	the	men	.
MRS.	BOND	:
Alicia	,	how	can	you	say	that	?
--------------------
ALlCIA	:
We	all	have	a	right	to	our	own	opinion	and	I	think	she	's	cruel	...	and	a	very	ill-	bred	person	.
[	Gasping	]
I	've	never	been	so	...
I	must	get	out	of	this	place	before	I	scream	.
Can	you	imagine	that	broad	discussing	me	in	that	manner	?
Say	,	I	like	them	brocades	.
Order	me	six	more	pair	in	the	morning	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
--------------------
Is	you	in	to	anyone	else	?
I	'm	meeting	all	comers	tonight	.
Sorry	,	I	believe	I	left	my	cane	inside	.
BEULAH	:
He	says	he	left	his	cane	.
TlRA	:
Come	in	,	Mr.	Lawrence	.
Let	's	find	it	.
It	isn	't	necessary	,	I	know	right	where	I	left	it	.
You	got	a	good	memory	.
--------------------
I	ought	to	,	since	I	left	it	here	on	purpose	.
TlRA	:
You	mean	you	planted	that	stick	?
KlRK	:
Sure	.
Had	to	find	a	way	to	see	you	alone	.
I	've	seen	your	show	three	times	and	I	think	you	're	wonderful	.
You	're	dazzling	,	beautiful	,	gorgeous	...
Wait	a	minute	,	take	it	slower	.
What	I	mean	is	,	let	's	get	better	acquainted	.
--------------------
You	know	,	we	can	have	a	lot	of	fun	together	.
You	'll	like	me	when	you	know	me	.
I	'm	not	half	bad	.
If	you	're	half	the	man	I	think	you	are	,	you	'll	do	.
I	am	.
Oh	,	well	.
Come	on	,	let	's	go	out	tonight	.
I	'll	ditch	the	crowd	.
I	told	you	I	have	a	previous	engagement	.
Break	it	.
--------------------
You	'll	never	regret	it	.
No	.
I	'd	love	to	,	but	I	've	got	to	meet	my	aunt	.
These	relatives	are	a	nuisance	at	times	.
What	about	tomorrow	?
For	breakfast	,	lunch	,	dinner	,	anything	.
Let	me	see	.
Breakfast	I	have	in	bed	,	so	that	's	out	.
TlRA	:
I	don	't	eat	lunch	,	and	dinner	...
--------------------
We	'll	make	it	supper	tomorrow	night	.
That	's	a	date	,	then	we	'll	go	out	.
I	like	sophisticated	men	to	take	me	out	.
I	'm	not	really	sophisticated	.
You	're	not	really	out	yet	,	either	.
You	got	me	.
Have	I	?
I	guess	I	'd	better	be	going	before	they	come	in	here	and	get	me	.
Tomorrow	night	,	then	.
That	's	the	night	.
--------------------
Beulah	,	bring	me	my	horoscope	.
Here	it	is	.
That	's	service	.
That	man	sure	is	crazy	about	you	,	ain	't	he	?
Crazy	about	me	?
The	guy	's	a	pushover	for	me	.
[	Jazzy	instrumental	music	]
MAN	1	:
Thank	you	,	Mr.	Lawrence	.
That	will	be	delivered	to	Miss	Tira	today	.
--------------------
MAN	2	:
We	will	deliver	the	card	to	Miss	Tira	on	Wednesday	.
WOMAN	:
All	right	,	Miss	Tira	,	Mr.	Lawrence	has	arranged	for	the	account	.
TlRA	:
Yeah	?
Now	let	me	see	.
BEULAH	:
My	,	oh	,	my	!
Look	at	that	.
--------------------
[	Beulah	murmuring	in	delight	]
[	Jazzy	instrumental	music	continues	]
[	Singing	]
Sing	it	,	honey	.
[	Singing	]
And	how	.
[	Singing	]
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Singing	]
Miss	Tira	,	you	got	something	.
--------------------
Something	not	bad	,	huh	?
Not	bad	?
I	've	never	seen	such	presents	as	this	here	Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	done	give	you	.
You	sure	skinned	him	pretty	.
You	only	knowed	him	a	week	.
Yeah	,	but	what	a	week	!
He	's	crazy	about	you	,	same	as	all	the	rest	.
I	don	't	see	how	any	man	could	help	loving	you	.
I	don	't	give	them	any	help	,	they	do	it	themselves	.
You	do	keep	me	busy	keeping	track	of	your	gentleman	friends	.
--------------------
I	want	to	make	it	easy	for	you	,	Beulah	...
I	'm	thinking	about	putting	in	a	filing	system	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Men	don	't	mean	a	thing	to	me	.
Be	careful	with	that	million-	dollar	foot	.
I	don	't	know	,	but	me	and	men	do	pretty	well	together	.
What	kind	of	men	do	you	like	,	Libby	?
I	'm	just	crazy	about	dark	men	.
Dark	men	?
--------------------
You	ought	to	have	a	big	time	in	Africa	.
LlBBY	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Don	't	get	those	nails	too	short	,	or	they	'll	think	I	bite	them	.
Miss	Tira	,	I	've	been	under	the	impression	you	is	a	one-	man	woman	.
I	am	,	one	man	at	a	time	.
TlRA	:
Beulah	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
--------------------
Fetch	me	that	importation	.
You	mean	this	one	?
TlRA	:
Yes	,	that	Parisian	one	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Singing	]
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
TlRA	:
[	Singing	]
--------------------
Sure	does	.
[	Singing	]
Come	on	.
TlRA	:
Is	it	a	flash	or	is	it	a	flash	?
MAlD	:
That	's	beautiful	.
I	know	it	's	beautiful	,	but	I	'm	asking	you	is	it	a	flash	?
It	's	a	flash	,	all	right	.
Kind	of	daring	,	huh	?
--------------------
Not	for	you	,	it	ain	't	.
That	's	all	I	want	to	know	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
If	that	's	that	house	detective	,	tell	him	I	'm	...
I	never	will	get	used	to	this	joint	.
Show	the	gentleman	in	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Get	me	my	beads	.
You	mean	that	pretty	necklace	you	just	had	give	to	you	?
Yeah	,	the	necklace	.
--------------------
I	will	say	beads	.
Pretty	,	ain	't	it	?
I	'll	say	it	is	.
I	just	wonder	how	much	money	that	costs	?
I	couldn	't	tell	you	right	now	,	but	I	have	an	idea	...
It	ain	't	no	he	,	it	's	a	she	.
Says	her	name	is	Miss	Hatton	.
Miss	who	?
Miss	Hatton	.
Pardon	me	.
--------------------
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
So	it	's	you	.
ALlCIA	:
You	know	why	I	'm	here	.
Hardly	.
You	see	I	'm	a	lion	tamer	,	not	a	mind	reader	.
Then	it	might	refresh	you	to	know	that	I	'm	Kirk	's	fiancée	.
Nothing	refreshing	about	that	.
I	want	to	know	just	what	you	intend	to	do	.
What	do	you	mean	?
--------------------
You	know	you	're	making	a	fool	of	him	.
He	ain	't	any	different	than	when	I	first	met	him	,	not	much	.
Everyone	knows	we	're	engaged	and	yet	you	're	deliberately	interfering	.
I	ain	't	interfering	with	nothing	.
If	Kirk	prefers	my	company	to	yours	...
No	,	he	doesn	't	,	he	only	imagines	he	does	.
I	'll	admit	the	boy	has	got	a	great	imagination	.
It	's	perfectly	obvious	what	your	intentions	are	.
Wait	a	minute	.
Whatever	you	're	thinking	,	you	're	wrong	.
--------------------
I	only	like	him	like	a	brother	.
You	ain	't	got	nothing	to	worry	about	.
You	're	a	liar	!
Say	,	listen	you	...	a	better	dame	than	you	once	called	me	a	liar	...	and	they	had	a	sew	her	up	in	12	different	places	.
You	're	lucky	I	'm	a	little	more	refined	than	I	used	to	be	.
And	if	you	were	as	much	a	lady	as	I	am	...	you	'd	get	out	of	here	before	I	get	real	sore	.
You	haven	't	a	streak	of	decency	in	you	.
I	don	't	show	my	good	points	to	strangers	.
I	'll	trouble	you	to	scram	.
Just	a	minute	.
--------------------
ALlCIA	:
I	realise	there	's	only	one	thing	that	will	influence	you	to	leave	Kirk	alone	.
How	much	?
TlRA	:
Beulah	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Peel	me	a	grape	.
JACK	:
I	can	't	wait	any	longer	.
--------------------
You	'd	better	go	.
I	'm	not	going	to	Texas	.
That	's	final	.
You	're	being	ridiculous	.
This	mad	infatuation	of	yours	for	this	...
lion	tamer	,	will	ruin	your	life	and	Alicia	's	,	too	.
Don	't	you	worry	about	Alicia	.
You	seem	to	forget	that	you	're	an	engaged	man	.
Jack	,	it	's	no	good	arguing	.
I	'll	handle	my	own	affairs	.
--------------------
You	're	gonna	continue	with	this	woman	?
Indefinitely	.
You	're	mad	.
Right	.
TlRA	:
Leave	that	where	you	found	it	.
Well	,	hello	,	baby	.
SLlCK	:
Here	I	am	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
So	I	see	.
When	'd	did	they	open	the	pearly	gates	for	you	?
SLlCK	:
Yesterday	.
Glad	to	see	me	?
Sure	,	don	't	I	look	it	?
And	you	ain	't	sore	.
Why	should	I	be	?
You	've	done	the	time	,	not	me	.
How	did	you	happen	to	come	up	here	?
--------------------
The	show	was	laying	off	this	week	,	so	I	looks	up	Barton	.
He	tells	me	what	a	swell	joint	you	got	here	.
You	've	done	pretty	nice	for	yourself	.
From	a	tent	to	a	penthouse	.
Yeah	,	this	is	a	great	layout	.
This	is	one	place	you	ain	't	laying	out	in	,	honey	.
I	guess	that	sort	of	means	I	don	't	exactly	fit	in	around	here	.
I	wouldn	't	say	that	.
The	whole	trouble	with	you	,	you	got	nervous	fingers	.
SLlCK	:
--------------------
I	'm	all	washed	up	with	that	.
What	are	you	figuring	on	doing	for	a	living	?
I	don	't	know	.
I	'm	sort	of	up	against	it	.
I	thought	maybe	you	might	...
Pulling	the	sob	on	me	?
No	,	I	...
I	'll	do	something	for	you	...	if	you	promise	to	keep	your	hands	in	your	own	pockets	.
Baby	,	I	'd	promise	you	anything	.
But	would	you	keep	it	?
--------------------
Do	you	want	me	to	swear	?
Never	mind	,	I	can	do	that	myself	.
Listen	,	go	see	Barton	.
Tell	him	I	said	to	find	something	for	you	to	do	over	there	.
And	here	,	take	this	.
But	don	't	make	a	habit	of	it	.
Get	yourself	some	clothes	so	you	start	looking	normal	again	.
Say	,	you	're	a	pal	.
You	know	there	never	was	a	dame	like	you	.
Forget	that	.
--------------------
Okay	,	but	I	just	want	you	to	know	I	'm	still	warm	for	you	,	baby	.
Maybe	I	'll	be	seeing	you	.
Make	it	soon	,	will	you	?
Get	going	.
That	guy	would	show	up	now	.
Excuse	me	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
Miss	Tira	's	apartment	?
Yes	,	sir	.
Just	say	if	she	can	spare	the	time	,	Mr.	Clayton	would	like	to	see	her	.
--------------------
BEULAH	:
I	will	if	I	can	remember	it	,	if	not	,	I	'll	just	say	he	's	here	.
Perhaps	that	will	do	as	well	.
TlRA	:
Take	the	gentleman	's	hat	and	coat	.
JACK	:
Thanks	.
I	hope	I	haven	't	disturbed	you	.
Not	so	far	.
Anything	I	can	do	for	you	?
--------------------
Yes	,	there	is	,	but	first	I	better	introduce	myself	.
That	's	not	necessary	,	I	know	who	you	are	.
I	've	heard	Kirk	speak	of	you	.
Good	,	that	simplifies	matters	.
It	's	on	Kirk	's	account	I	'm	here	.
I	see	.
Let	's	sit	down	and	be	comfortable	about	it	.
I	hope	I	can	come	right	to	the	point	.
About	this	situation	between	you	and	Kirk	...	he	's	neglecting	important	business	on	your	account	.
And	there	's	Miss	Hatton	,	his	fiancée	,	to	be	considered	.
--------------------
TlRA	:
She	's	a	novel	twist	.
Of	course	,	I	know	you	have	no	liking	for	Miss	Hatton	.
She	came	in	here	,	got	nasty	,	I	had	to	put	her	in	her	place	.
Yes	,	I	heard	you	had	some	slight	misunderstanding	.
Do	you	mind	if	I	get	personal	?
Go	right	ahead	.
I	don	't	mind	if	you	get	familiar	.
It	's	all	in	the	family	.
Well	,	then	,	do	you	really	care	for	Kirk	?
--------------------
I	mean	,	do	you	love	him	?
I	don	't	know	.
See	,	my	horoscope	says	so	.
I	'm	afraid	I	don	't	understand	.
I	'm	afraid	I	don	't	understand	it	myself	sometimes	.
You	see	,	it	describes	a	guy	,	I	mean	,	a	man	like	Kirk	.
Surely	you	're	not	being	serious	.
Why	,	I	certainly	am	.
My	whole	life	is	ruled	by	astrology	.
JACK	:
--------------------
Well	...
What	colour	eyes	have	you	got	?
I	don	't	know	.
Fine	.
Well	,	as	you	were	saying	...
You	're	telling	me	simply	because	Kirk	fits	some	description	in	your	horoscope	...	that	you	'd	deliberately	break	up	things	between	him	and	Miss	Hatton	?
Maybe	it	would	be	a	good	break	for	him	.
Surely	you	wouldn	't	let	personal	dislike	destroy	their	engagement	.
Unless	,	of	course	,	you	have	serious	intentions	.
What	if	I	have	?
--------------------
I	'm	afraid	that	's	impossible	.
Listen	,	with	me	nothing	is	impossible	.
That	may	be	.
But	I	'm	here	to	tell	you	,	if	you	're	thinking	of	marrying	Kirk	,	you	better	not	count	on	it	.
TlRA	:
Kirk	sent	you	up	here	with	that	line	?
JACK	:
He	doesn	't	know	I	'm	here	.
I	get	it	.
You	figure	the	family	honour	needs	protecting	.
--------------------
A	circus	dame	would	be	sort	of	a	red	leaf	on	the	family	tree	,	is	that	it	?
Please	understand	that	it	's	been	difficult	for	me	...	to	come	here	and	talk	to	you	about	what	you	no	doubt	consider	is	none	of	my	business	.
That	's	all	right	,	I	don	't	care	.
If	someone	's	got	something	on	their	mind	,	I	like	them	to	get	it	off	.
You	're	an	unusual	sort	of	person	.
I	've	been	accused	of	that	.
As	a	matter	of	fact	,	I	'd	much	rather	have	met	you	under	pleasanter	circumstances	.
Same	here	,	there	's	no	hard	feelings	.
Of	course	not	.
I	shouldn	't	want	you	to	feel	unfriendly	toward	me	.
--------------------
I	shouldn	't	want	you	to	get	the	impression	that	I	'm	just	an	adventuress	.
I	didn	't	think	that	.
What	did	you	think	?
I	had	no	definite	idea	what	you	would	be	like	.
I	've	seen	newspaper	pictures	of	you	.
Yeah	?
Ever	seen	this	one	here	?
There	's	one	of	my	favourites	.
It	looks	just	like	you	.
It	should	,	I	posed	for	it	.
--------------------
You	like	it	?
Yes	.
You	can	have	it	.
No	,	thanks	,	I	wouldn	't	want	to	deprive	you	...
It	's	all	right	,	I	get	them	by	the	hundreds	,	frame	and	all	.
Well	,	in	that	case	...
Won	't	you	stay	?
I	'll	ring	for	tea	.
No	,	thanks	,	really	,	I	must	be	going	.
You	've	been	wonderful	.
--------------------
You	've	been	kind	of	wonderful	yourself	.
Thank	you	.
Now	you	'll	consider	all	I	've	said	and	try	and	bring	Kirk	to	his	senses	.
I	can	't	promise	anything	right	now	,	but	...	you	have	started	a	new	train	of	thought	in	my	mind	.
I	'll	think	it	over	and	let	you	know	what	I	decide	.
You	'd	be	doing	a	fine	thing	.
Yeah	?
Fine	for	who	?
For	all	of	us	.
You	're	kind	of	unusual	yourself	.
--------------------
I	've	been	accused	of	that	.
Now	you	can	reach	me	there	at	any	time	.
And	I	want	to	thank	you	for	the	way	you	received	me	.
And	you	can	reach	me	there	at	any	time	.
You	'll	hear	from	me	.
JACK	:
That	will	be	fine	.
You	fascinate	me	.
You	'd	better	go	.
JACK	:
--------------------
Good	night	.
[	Telephone	buzzing	]
JACK	:
Hello	.
SECRETARY	:
Good	.
Put	her	on	.
Mr.	Clayton	?
I	've	been	thinking	over	everything	you	said	and	...
I	've	made	my	decision	.
--------------------
Good	.
I	'm	glad	you	made	up	your	mind	quickly	.
I	'm	very	quick	in	a	slow	way	.
You	see	I	can	't	discuss	it	over	the	phone	.
It	's	got	a	lot	of	angles	to	it	.
You	better	come	up	and	see	me	.
I	'll	be	glad	to	.
In	fact	,	I	'll	come	over	right	away	if	it	's	convenient	for	you	.
Most	convenient	.
I	'll	tell	you	this	much	...	you	're	gonna	like	what	I	got	in	mind	.
--------------------
I	'll	be	ready	.
Goodbye	.
Hello	,	honey	.
Good	evening	,	Miss	Tira	.
If	anyone	should	call	,	I	'm	indisposed	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
TlRA	:
You	know	what	I	mean	,	don	't	you	?
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
--------------------
Come	here	,	dear	.
JACK	:
I	haven	't	had	you	alone	all	evening	with	all	those	people	.
My	public	.
Let	me	take	a	good	look	at	you	.
You	were	wonderful	tonight	.
I	'm	always	wonderful	at	night	.
Yes	,	but	tonight	you	were	especially	good	.
When	I	'm	good	,	I	'm	very	good	.
But	when	I	'm	bad	...
--------------------
I	'm	better	.
Don	't	go	away	,	I	'll	be	right	back	.
[	Tira	humming	softly	]
TlRA	:
[	Singing	]
BEULAH	:
You	must	've	had	a	good	time	,	you	seem	so	happy	.
If	I	wasn	't	,	you	'd	know	it	.
Get	me	another	gown	,	Beulah	.
I	've	danced	this	one	around	all	evening	.
--------------------
I	gotta	give	it	a	rest	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Which	one	?
That	lucky	one	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Playing	a	soft	tune	]
[	Jack	playing	a	jazzy	tune	]
That	guy	's	got	rhythm	,	eh	?
Yes	,	I	know	what	you	means	.
Bring	out	a	couple	of	drinks	and	then	you	two	dames	can	retire	.
--------------------
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Open	up	that	door	.
Here	goes	my	big	moment	.
[	Beulah	murmurs	in	agreement	]
Don	't	stop	,	honey	,	you	put	me	in	the	mood	.
It	's	good	to	be	here	alone	with	you	,	dear	.
I	kind	of	like	it	,	too	.
The	only	thing	I	've	got	to	be	jealous	.
Of	course	,	if	I	could	only	trust	you	.
--------------------
You	can	,	hundreds	have	.
Do	you	know	I	'm	mad	about	you	?
I	could	tell	you	'd	be	,	the	first	time	I	saw	you	.
Say	,	I	must	be	transparent	.
Honey	,	you	're	just	wrapped	in	cellophane	.
Come	on	,	darling	.
Be	serious	.
You	want	me	to	?
Sure	I	do	.
All	right	,	now	I	'm	very	serious	.
--------------------
I	adore	you	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
How	am	I	doing	,	Beulah	?
You	're	doing	fine	,	you	're	doing	grand	.
I	'll	do	better	when	you	are	gone	,	you	rascal	,	you	!
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	,	I	know	you	will	,	ma	'am	.
Great	gals	,	huh	?
[	Tira	playing	a	soft	tune	]
--------------------
Honey	,	I	wonder	if	you	realise	just	how	much	you	mean	to	me	.
I	've	never	been	so	happy	in	my	life	.
You	mean	that	?
I	guess	love	is	a	wonderful	thing	.
Yes	,	I	've	heard	it	highly	praised	.
[	Singing	]
Move	over	,	honey	,	and	don	't	stop	.
I	'll	never	stop	.
[	Singing	]
Darling	,	you	can	never	guess	how	much	I	love	you	.
--------------------
I	'll	never	guess	,	you	've	got	to	you	show	me	.
Just	give	me	the	chance	.
You	'll	get	it	.
[	Singing	]
I	could	be	your	slave	.
I	guess	that	could	be	arranged	.
[	Singing	]
What	have	you	done	to	me	?
You	ought	to	know	.
[	Singing	]
--------------------
What	are	you	gonna	do	about	it	?
[	Romantic	instrumental	music	]
What	's	this	in	the	paper	about	you	marrying	this	rich	guy	,	Clayton	?
If	it	's	publicity	it	's	great	,	and	if	it	ain	't	,	it	's	no	good	.
I	'm	quitting	the	show	.
You	're	quitting	?
Yeah	,	I	'm	sick	of	this	racket	.
I	found	the	right	man	,	I	'm	gonna	get	married	.
You	can	't	quit	.
You	got	a	five	year	contract	with	me	.
--------------------
Yeah	?
Did	you	ever	read	it	?
It	says	for	a	good	cause	you	could	give	a	two	week	's	notice	.
I	'm	giving	you	that	notice	now	.
But	you	ain	't	got	no	good	cause	.
Marriage	is	a	good	enough	cause	for	anything	.
BlG	BlLL	:
You	can	't	do	that	to	me	and	get	away	with	it	.
No	?
What	's	my	picture	doing	by	that	skunk	?
--------------------
I	figured	it	belonged	there	.
What	do	you	mean	?
Everybody	used	to	call	me	"	The	Bull	.	"
You	may	be	the	bull	to	them	,	but	you	're	just	plain	skunk	to	me	.
BlG	BlLL	:
I	got	everything	set	.
All	right	.
But	suppose	Tira	gets	back	before	we	spring	it	.
I	got	the	chauffer	fixed	...	so	there	'll	be	trouble	with	the	car	on	the	road	.
Now	,	get	going	.
--------------------
Every	minute	counts	.
Can	't	you	hurry	and	get	that	thing	fixed	,	I	gotta	get	back	.
I	'm	expecting	Mr.	Clayton	at	the	apartment	.
CHAUFFER	:
Doing	the	best	I	can	,	ma	'am	.
Your	best	is	no	good	,	try	your	worst	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Say	,	where	are	we	?
I	thought	we	were	in	Jersey	.
CHAUFFER	:
--------------------
We	're	in	Jersey	,	ma	'am	.
You	sure	you	didn	't	take	the	wrong	road	and	land	in	Brazil	?
CHAUFFER	:
No	,	ma	'am	.
Come	on	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
Tira	.
SLlCK	:
What	do	you	want	?
--------------------
You	're	Clayton	.
I	know	all	about	you	and	Tira	.
But	that	's	all	finished	.
I	've	been	away	,	but	I	'm	back	again	and	she	ain	't	wanting	no	change	.
We	're	going	on	just	the	same	as	before	.
Get	it	?
No	,	I	don	't	get	it	.
Where	's	Miss	Tira	?
She	ain	't	here	now	.
She	knew	you	was	coming	and	she	didn	't	want	to	see	you	.
--------------------
What	're	you	talking	about	?
SLlCK	:
She	didn	't	like	to	tell	you	herself	,	so	I	'm	doing	it	for	her	.
Yes	,	I	guess	that	's	enough	.
This	is	the	right	thing	to	do	,	Jack	.
With	a	woman	of	her	type	,	this	would	have	happened	sooner	or	later	.
If	you	ask	me	,	I	think	you	're	lucky	.
Maybe	you	are	right	.
Frank	,	get	a	messenger	and	send	that	at	once	,	will	you	?
I	'm	gonna	be	out	of	town	for	three	or	four	weeks	.
--------------------
In	the	meantime	,	I	'm	out	to	all	callers	.
Everybody	,	understand	?
Is	that	message	for	Miss	Tira	,	too	?
Yes	.
But	I	understood	you	were	to	be	married	this	month	.
We	're	both	mistaken	.
FRANK	:
Yes	,	sir	.
[	Singing	]
You	sure	gonna	make	a	gorgeous	bride	.
--------------------
I	know	I	'm	gonna	make	a	nervous	bride	.
I	ain	't	never	done	this	before	.
Marriage	is	a	new	kind	of	racket	for	me	.
I	've	been	married	four	times	.
You	ought	to	do	well	in	the	wholesale	business	.
[	Laughing	]
[	Doorbell	buzzing	]
I	don	't	wanna	see	anyone	but	Mr.	Clayton	.
MAlD	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
--------------------
That	Mr.	Clayton	is	sure	a	wonderful	man	.
I	'll	say	he	is	.
I	never	knew	I	could	go	for	anyone	like	I	have	for	him	.
He	made	me	feel	like	a	different	dame	.
I	ain	't	just	a	"	Sister	Honky	Tonk	"	no	more	.
You	're	a	lady	now	.
Thank	you	.
MAlD	:
Some	messenger	gave	me	this	note	to	give	you	,	Miss	Tira	.
Yeah	?
--------------------
You	can	go	.
This	is	Miss	Tira	speaking	.
I	'm	sorry	,	madam	,	Mr.	Clayton	's	gone	away	.
Gone	away	?
When	is	he	expected	back	?
I	couldn	't	say	definitely	but	I	'm	sure	not	for	several	weeks	.
Is	that	the	only	message	he	left	for	me	?
Yes	,	that	's	all	.
Thanks	.
BENNY	:
--------------------
Hello	,	Tira	darling	.
TlRA	:
Benny	.
BENNY	:
How	are	you	?
You	look	so	marvellous	.
Come	right	in	,	sit	right	down	and	make	yourself	at	home	.
BENNY	:
Let	me	look	at	that	beautiful	smile	of	yours	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
You	know	about	me	getting	married	?
BENNY	:
Sure	.
Congratulations	.
Too	late	.
It	's	all	off	.
TlRA	:
Sue	the	guy	for	breach	of	promise	.
BENNY	:
Certainly	.
--------------------
The	lowlife	.
No	,	he	ain	't	,	Benny	.
The	first	guy	I	ever	really	loved	.
I	thought	he	loved	me	,	too	.
What	a	tragedy	.
We	start	proceedings	immediately	.
BENNY	:
How	much	is	he	worth	?
TlRA	:
Millions	.
--------------------
Millions	?
We	sue	him	for	damages	.
I	ain	't	damaged	.
I	just	want	you	to	sue	him	for	breach	of	promise	.
I	got	all	the	proof	you	want	,	letters	,	wires	,	newspaper	stories	,	even	my	trousseau	.
For	that	trousseau	alone	we	collect	plenty	.
It	's	a	cinch	.
When	do	you	want	the	case	tried	?
Let	me	see	.
I	go	on	the	road	with	the	show	and	...
--------------------
I	'll	be	back	in	a	few	months	.
Better	start	then	.
Easy	.
Got	the	case	.
Darling	,	you	give	me	a	few	details	and	I	'll	serve	him	with	papers	right	away	.
Okay	.
First	,	I	'll	tell	you	how	I	met	the	guy	.
But	remember	in	anything	I	say	I	ain	't	got	any	real	animosity	for	him	.
Of	course	.
If	I	was	a	home	girl	,	I	'd	be	heartbroken	.
--------------------
Yes	.
Miss	Tira	,	I	understand	you	've	had	a	rather	colourful	past	.
I	gotta	admit	I	've	been	the	love	interest	in	more	than	one	guy	's	life	.
[	Jurors	laughing	]
I	don	't	see	what	my	past	has	got	to	do	with	my	present	.
We	shall	show	that	to	the	satisfaction	of	the	court	,	I	believe	.
Nevertheless	,	the	fact	remains	that	you	've	been	on	...	friendly	terms	with	several	men	.
All	right	,	I	'm	a	sweetheart	of	Sphigma	Psi	,	so	what	?
You	must	answer	questions	directly	,	please	.
Pardon	me	,	Judge	.
--------------------
Proceed	.
Do	you	know	a	man	named	Wiley	...	generally	called	Slick	?
TlRA	:
Yes	,	I	know	the	...
The	gentleman	.
And	you	recall	the	man	you	see	there	?
If	I	'm	not	mistaken	,	you	mean	that	Dallas	man	.
BOB	:
And	you	are	also	acquainted	,	aren	't	you	,	with	Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	?
Yes	,	I	had	the	pleasure	.
--------------------
And	no	doubt	you	recall	those	five	gentlemen	...	seated	in	the	first	row	right	inside	the	railing	?
Mr.	Foster	,	Mr.	Harris	.
I	do	recall	their	faces	but	them	ain	't	the	names	they	gave	me	.
Pardon	me	again	,	Judge	.
It	's	all	right	.
That	's	all	,	Miss	Tira	.
JUDGE	:
Does	the	plaintiff	's	attorney	wish	any	further	questions	?
I	would	like	to	request	recess	for	about	10	minutes	.
JUDGE	:
--------------------
Is	that	agreeable	to	the	defence	?
BOB	:
Perfectly	.
This	court	's	adjourned	for	10	minutes	.
BENNY	:
Why	did	you	admit	that	you	knew	all	these	men	?
I	do	know	them	.
You	don	't	want	me	to	commit	perjury	?
Yes	,	why	didn	't	you	tell	me	there	was	so	many	men	in	your	life	?
Why	shouldn	't	I	know	guys	?
--------------------
I	've	been	around	.
I	travel	from	coast	to	coast	.
A	dame	like	me	can	't	make	trips	like	that	without	meeting	any	of	the	male	population	.
Listen	to	me	,	Tira	.
You	know	me	,	I	'm	a	smart	lawyer	.
Give	me	that	much	loophole	and	I	'm	through	it	like	an	eel	.
With	what	all	those	guys	,	all	those	riffraffs	,	pardon	me	...	going	up	to	the	judge	and	telling	all	they	know	about	you	and	them	.
It	's	curtains	for	us	.
You	mean	we	're	finished	?
Yeah	,	sure	,	drop	it	.
--------------------
You	had	enough	publicity	.
What	those	guys	are	gonna	tell	the	judge	won	't	read	so	nice	in	the	newspapers	.
I	ain	't	gonna	drop	it	.
Listen	,	Benny	,	have	I	a	right	to	question	witnesses	myself	?
Yeah	,	sure	but	...
That	's	what	I	'm	gonna	do	.
You	don	't	mean	it	.
Now	Mr.	Brown	,	just	tell	the	jury	in	your	words	,	what	took	place	.
I	was	watching	her	dance	and	I	seen	her	looking	at	me	.
I	kind	of	looked	back	and	she	flirted	and	made	a	date	with	me	.
--------------------
So	,	I	took	her	out	for	a	ride	in	my	car	...	and	she	asked	me	up	to	her	hotel	room	where	she	was	living	.
We	had	a	couple	of	drinks	...	and	she	put	on	a	phonograph	record	and	we	danced	.
And	while	we	was	dancing	,	she	kissed	me	.
And	how	long	were	you	with	Miss	Tira	in	her	hotel	room	?
Close	to	a	couple	hours	,	I	should	say	.
That	's	all	,	Mr.	Brown	.
Cross-	examine	.
BENNY	:
My	client	begs	the	permission	of	the	court	...	to	question	the	defence	witness	herself	.
It	's	a	little	unusual	,	but	quite	within	the	plaintiff	's	right	.
--------------------
JUDGE	:
She	may	question	the	witnesses	.
BOB	:
If	you	please	...	the	court	should	warn	the	jury	not	to	be	swayed	...	by	any	theatricalism	by	the	plaintiff	.
JUDGE	:
The	jury	in	weighing	the	evidence	will	bear	in	mind	the	defence	's	warning	.
Lovely	tie	.
Mr.	Brown	,	aren	't	you	the	man	that	had	the	five	wives	?
Yeah	.
And	you	was	married	to	one	when	you	were	with	me	,	wasn	't	you	?
--------------------
Yes	.
Cheating	.
You	made	it	sound	nasty	the	way	you	spoke	about	us	two	...	being	alone	together	in	my	place	.
And	you	know	nothing	happened	that	you	couldn	't	tell	your	grandchildren	about	.
Well	,	I	...
In	other	words	,	it	was	just	a	harmless	little	social	date	,	wasn	't	it	?
Yeah	.
Okay	,	I	'm	through	with	you	.
[	All	laughing	]
How	am	I	doing	?
--------------------
Any	further	questions	?
You	're	excused	,	Mr.	Brown	.
Next	witness	.
Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	.
BAlLIFF	:
Mr.	Kirk	Lawrence	,	take	the	stand	.
OFFlCER	:
Quiet	,	please	.
BAlLIFF	:
Do	you	solemnly	swear	to	tell	the	whole	truth	...	and	nothing	but	the	truth	,	so	help	you	God	?
--------------------
KlRK	:
I	do	.
BAlLIFF	:
Take	the	stand	.
BOB	:
Aren	't	you	well-	acquainted	with	the	plaintiff	?
Yes	.
In	fact	,	you	were	intimate	friends	.
Yes	.
Isn	't	it	true	that	you	once	seriously	contemplated	asking	her	to	marry	you	?
--------------------
Yes	.
Now	,	I	understand	that	after	knowing	you	only	a	week	...	the	plaintiff	accepted	several	thousand	dollars	worth	of	gifts	from	you	.
Such	as	a	diamond	bracelet	...
BOB	:
Gowns	,	a	fur	coat	...
KlRK	:
That	's	correct	.
BOB	:
And	almost	immediately	after	accepting	these	gifts	...	she	became	engaged	to	Mr.	Clayton	,	isn	't	that	so	?
Yes	.
--------------------
And	after	becoming	engaged	she	refused	to	talk	to	you	,	even	on	the	telephone	.
Yes	.
Mr.	Clayton	has	more	money	than	you	have	,	hasn	't	he	?
That	's	true	.
What	construction	did	you	place	upon	this	woman	's	treatment	of	you	?
In	plain	words	,	I	felt	she	simply	played	me	for	a	good	thing	.
BOB	:
Thank	you	,	Mr.	Lawrence	.
Your	witness	.
You	're	not	looking	to	get	those	presents	back	,	are	you	,	Mr.	Lawrence	?
--------------------
No	,	of	course	not	.
I	don	't	expect	you	to	return	them	,	anyway	.
You	're	right	,	I	wouldn	't	.
You	gave	me	those	presents	because	you	liked	me	a	little	,	didn	't	you	?
Yes	.
I	didn	't	ask	you	for	them	,	did	I	?
I	don	't	regret	giving	them	to	you	,	if	that	's	what	you	mean	.
Thanks	,	I	didn	't	think	you	did	.
Now	,	you	was	engaged	to	marry	a	girl	...	just	at	the	time	you	started	running	around	with	me	,	wasn	't	you	?
Yes	.
--------------------
And	you	know	your	fiancée	came	up	to	me	to	see	me	...	to	ask	me	to	break	it	off	with	you	,	don	't	you	?
I	heard	so	.
All	right	,	I	broke	it	off	.
So	what	are	you	crying	about	?
Your	Honour	,	this	sort	of	questioning	is	most	irregular	.
The	plaintiff	,	not	being	a	practicing	attorney	...	may	put	her	questions	as	best	she	can	.
Thanks	,	Judge	,	you	're	regular	.
I	'm	doing	my	best	to	be	legitimate	.
That	's	all	with	you	.
JUDGE	:
--------------------
Any	further	questions	?
BOB	:
Defence	is	ready	for	the	next	witness	.
JUDGE	:
Excused	.
JUDGE	:
Proceed	.
BOB	:
Miss	Beulah	Thorndyke	.
They	had	nerve	enough	to	call	my	own	maid	to	squeal	on	me	?
--------------------
BOB	:
You	are	Miss	Tira	's	personal	maid	,	aren	't	you	?
I	was	,	but	I	ain	't	sure	now	.
BOB	:
As	her	personal	maid	,	it	was	your	duty	to	answer	telephone	calls	...	and	admit	visitors	to	the	apartment	?
Yes	,	ma	'am	...
Yes	,	sir	.
BOB	:
Miss	Tira	often	had	gentlemen	callers	,	didn	't	she	?
Quite	some	.
--------------------
BOB	:
During	the	time	Miss	Tira	and	Mr.	Clayton	were	engaged	...	did	she	have	other	men	visitors	?
Not	that	I	recall	.
You	have	a	very	convenient	memory	.
That	's	all	.
Cross-	examine	.
TlRA	:
Shadow	,	what	are	you	doing	here	?
BEULAH	:
I	don	't	know	.
--------------------
They	done	subpoenaed	me	.
Beulah	,	tell	the	boys	the	truth	.
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
After	Mr.	Clayton	and	me	became	engaged	...	did	you	ever	hear	me	talk	about	any	other	man	...	or	did	you	ever	see	me	with	any	other	man	...
outside	of	my	manager	,	Mr.	Barton	?
No	,	ma	'am	.
Did	you	ever	hear	me	make	any	cracks	about	Mr.	Clayton	's	money	?
No	,	ma	'am	.
Did	you	hear	me	talk	about	Mr.	Clayton	?
Oh	,	yes	,	ma	'am	.
--------------------
What	did	you	hear	me	say	?
You	said	...
Just	a	minute	.
Tell	the	jury	.
Is	that	all	right	with	you	,	Judge	?
Yes	.
Proceed	.
You	said	that	you	never	knew	you	could	love	a	man	like	you	love	him	.
I	kind	of	forgot	I	said	that	.
And	you	said	you	had	fallen	so	hard	for	him	that	it	hurt	.
--------------------
Wait	a	minute	.
Answer	one	question	at	a	time	.
I	just	telling	the	truth	like	you	told	me	to	.
Yes	,	but	you	're	telling	too	much	of	it	.
I	ain	't	never	seen	nobody	so	brokenhearted	as	you	was	...	when	you	and	Mr.	Clayton	done	bust	up	.
That	's	enough	,	Beulah	.
You	're	ruining	my	character	.
BOB	:
I	object	,	Your	Honour	.
This	witness	'	testimony	is	entirely	irrelevant	.
--------------------
I	move	to	strike	it	from	record	.
JUDGE	:
Motion	denied	.
JUDGE	:
Any	more	questions	?
BOB	:
No	.
JUDGE	:
You	're	excused	.
Next	witness	.
--------------------
Call	Mr.	Slick	Wiley	to	the	stand	.
BAlLIFF	:
Mr.	Wiley	,	Mr.	Slick	Wiley	,	please	take	the	stand	.
Bob	,	do	you	have	to	question	this	man	?
Of	course	,	Jack	.
He	'll	win	our	case	for	us	.
She	can	't	laugh	him	off	.
Don	't	mention	the	night	I	found	him	at	her	apartment	.
I	've	got	to	ask	him	about	that	.
BOB	:
--------------------
That	's	what	I	'm	depending	on	.
JACK	:
I	don	't	want	you	to	mention	it	.
All	right	,	I	'll	keep	it	as	clean	as	I	can	.
When	he	gets	through	with	Slick	,	we	haven	't	got	a	chance	.
Mr.	Wiley	,	you	know	the	plaintiff	,	Miss	Tira	,	very	well	,	do	you	not	?
Sure	,	we	've	been	like	that	.
During	the	time	...	the	plaintiff	was	engaged	to	the	defendant	,	Mr.	Clayton	...	were	you	friendly	with	her	?
Never	better	.
Isn	't	it	true	the	plaintiff	used	to	give	you	sums	of	money	at	times	for	your	own	use	?
--------------------
Yeah	,	sure	.
She	was	always	a	good	for	anywhere	from	$10	to	a	C-	note	.
Isn	't	it	also	a	fact	...	that	you	kept	personal	belongings	in	the	plaintiff	's	apartment	?
SLlCK	:
You	mean	in	pyjamas	?
BOB	:
Yes	.
Yeah	,	I	always	kept	two	pair	there	.
Silk	ones	.
One	green	and	one	purple	with	yellow	stripes	.
--------------------
[	All	laughing	]
[	Judge	knocks	gavel	]
Mr.	Wiley	,	did	the	plaintiff	ever	suggest	to	you	...	her	interest	in	the	defendant	was	principally	because	of	his	wealth	?
Yeah	,	sure	.
SLlCK	:
She	always	looked	to	hook	some	guy	with	a	lot	of	dough	.
That	's	all	,	Mr.	Wiley	.
Cross-	examine	.
TlRA	:
Where	were	you	on	the	night	of	June	7	?
--------------------
I	don	't	remember	.
All	right	,	I	'll	give	you	a	choice	,	where	were	you	any	night	last	June	,	July	,	or	August	?
Come	on	,	make	up	your	mind	.
In	stir	.
That	's	it	,	speak	up	so	they	can	hear	you	.
He	was	in	stir	.
That	means	,	in	other	words	,	gentlemen	of	the	jury	,	he	was	in	jail	.
Tell	the	gentlemen	how	many	other	jails	you	been	in	the	last	10	years	.
I	don	't	remember	.
TlRA	:
--------------------
He	can	't	remember	.
You	forgot	to	tell	these	good	people	...	the	only	time	I	gave	you	money	was	when	you	got	out	of	jail	...	you	were	broke	,	and	walking	on	your	heels	.
You	heel	.
As	for	you	sitting	in	my	apartment	in	silk	pyjamas	...	you	never	sat	around	my	apartment	in	nothing	.
And	you	know	it	.
Answer	me	,	did	you	?
Sure	,	I	did	.
And	I	was	seen	there	,	too	.
Why	you	...
You	perjurer	.
--------------------
I	object	to	the	witness	being	harassed	this	way	.
Who	's	harassing	who	?
I	'm	just	asking	for	a	square	deal	,	that	's	all	.
I	'm	asking	good	,	honest	,	and	intelligent	people	not	to	take	...	the	word	of	an	ex-	convict	against	a	good	,	honest	and	innocent	woman	.
I	object	,	Your	Honour	.
JUDGE	:
Objection	overruled	.
TlRA	:
You	're	right	,	Judge	.
[	All	laughing	]
--------------------
There	you	are	.
She	's	got	the	jury	and	the	judge	under	her	arm	.
They	'll	hand	her	the	case	on	a	silver	platter	.
Don	't	be	unfair	.
Unfair	?
You	've	got	so	much	money	,	you	don	't	mind	losing	this	case	.
But	my	reputation	means	something	to	me	.
If	ever	there	was	a	case	I	wanted	to	win	,	this	is	it	.
I	told	you	not	to	put	the	man	on	the	stand	in	the	first	place	.
You	'll	have	to	take	stand	and	tell	your	story	.
--------------------
I	'll	do	nothing	of	the	kind	.
If	you	feel	that	way	about	it	,	why	did	you	contest	the	case	at	all	?
I	'm	sorry	I	did	.
If	any	right-	thinking	man	will	believe	what	a	crook	and	a	jailbird	will	say	...	then	there	's	nothing	I	could	say	that	'll	make	any	difference	.
I	'm	through	with	this	guy	,	Judge	.
Do	you	wish	to	question	the	witness	further	?
Yes	.
I	have	a	few	questions	I	should	like	to	ask	.
Mr.	Wiley	...
Stop	.
--------------------
Sit	down	.
That	's	enough	.
Call	it	off	.
I	'll	settle	for	the	amount	asked	.
You	're	absolutely	mad	.
I	don	't	want	it	to	go	any	further	,	do	you	understand	?
All	right	,	have	it	your	own	way	.
If	you	want	to	make	a	fool	of	yourself	over	this	woman	,	I	can	't	stop	you	.
Don	't	try	to	.
BOB	:
--------------------
Your	Honour	...	my	client	has	requested	me	,	for	some	peculiar	reason	of	his	own	...	to	cease	contest	of	this	suit	.
He	's	prepared	to	settle	for	the	full	amount	of	the	case	.
JUDGE	:
How	extraordinary	.
BOB	:
I	'll	say	it	is	.
What	is	this	,	Benny	?
Don	't	ask	me	,	I	'm	paralysed	.
Sounds	like	a	trick	.
Does	the	plaintiff	accept	this	motion	as	satisfaction	of	this	suit	?
--------------------
Okay	,	the	plaintiff	accepts	it	with	pleasure	.
JUDGE	:
In	view	of	the	agreement	between	the	parties	...	the	jury	is	discharged	with	thanks	.
Case	dismissed	.
Court	's	adjourned	.
JUROR	1	:
I	'm	glad	you	won	your	case	,	Miss	Tira	.
JUROR	2	:
That	's	our	pleasure	.
Wait	a	minute	.
--------------------
Boys	,	now	,	take	it	easy	.
I	'll	give	you	all	the	breaks	in	the	world	but	don	't	crowd	.
Pictures	first	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	1	:
Miss	Tira	,	would	you	stand	up	?
Of	course	,	if	it	'll	make	you	happy	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	2	:
Look	this	way	,	please	.
Wait	a	minute	boys	,	one	at	a	time	.
I	'm	not	twins	.
--------------------
[	All	laughing	]
PHOTOGRAPHER	3	:
Hold	that	pose	,	please	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	3	:
That	's	it	.
All	right	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	4	:
Hold	for	me	,	please	.
PHOTOGRAPHER	4	:
Thank	you	.
--------------------
Will	you	answer	a	few	questions	,	Miss	Tira	?
Of	course	.
You	've	won	the	case	.
What	do	you	intend	to	do	?
Carry	on	the	same	as	before	.
Why	did	you	admit	knowing	so	many	men	in	your	life	?
It	's	not	the	men	in	your	life	that	counts	,	it	's	the	life	in	your	men	.
REPORTER	:
Do	you	feel	you	've	done	right	?
TlRA	:
--------------------
Show	me	a	woman	who	can	do	better	.
You	were	right	,	Judge	.
It	was	nice	of	you	to	come	up	.
Thank	you	.
You	've	been	charming	,	my	dear	.
Very	charming	.
I	'm	glad	you	found	that	out	.
Of	course	.
Well	,	goodbye	.
I	see	you	've	that	hand	trouble	,	too	,	huh	?
--------------------
Goodbye	again	.
Goodbye	.
[	Telephone	ringing	]
Hello	?
Juror	Number	4	.
Yes	,	I	remember	you	.
You	were	the	one	with	the	nice	,	kind	face	.
I	know	you	were	for	me	.
I	wanna	thank	you	for	those	beautiful	flowers	.
They	were	lovely	.
--------------------
And	don	't	forget	,	come	up	and	see	me	sometime	.
BEULAH	:
Mr.	Clayton	,	how	is	you	?
Yes	.
All	right	,	goodbye	.
You	said	things	in	the	courtroom	that	led	me	to	believe	you	loved	me	.
That	you	still	love	me	.
Did	you	mean	them	?
What	difference	does	it	make	now	?
All	the	difference	in	the	world	.
--------------------
You	didn	't	believe	me	before	.
Because	I	didn	't	understand	about	Slick	being	up	here	that	night	.
So	that	's	it	.
I	didn	't	understand	it	myself	till	I	found	out	it	was	all	a	big	frame-	up	.
To	keep	me	from	leaving	the	show	.
Then	let	's	forget	the	whole	thing	and	go	on	together	.
You	sure	you	want	it	that	way	?
You	know	I	do	.
Sit	down	.
You	're	everything	to	me	.
--------------------
TlRA	:
Beulah	.
BEULAH	:
Yes	,	ma	'am	.
Bring	me	my	jewel	case	.
You	're	more	fascinating	than	ever	.
I	get	better	as	I	go	along	.
BEULAH	:
Here	,	Miss	Tira	.
Got	something	for	you	.
--------------------
I	'm	glad	to	know	it	wasn	't	the	money	you	wanted	.
You	got	a	lot	of	other	things	it	takes	to	make	a	woman	happy	.
[	Jazzy	instrumental	music	]
JACK	:
I	'm	crazy	about	you	.
I	did	my	best	to	make	you	that	way	.
Look	,	darling	,	you	need	a	rest	,	and	so	do	I.
Let	me	take	you	away	somewhere	.
Would	you	call	that	a	rest	?
What	are	you	thinking	about	?
--------------------
The	same	thing	you	are	.

Cut	it	out	!
Does	someone	need	this	?
No	.
Kolka	.
Kolya	.
Nikolai	...
Kolka	!
What	do	you	want	?
Go	to	the	front	line	!
--------------------
Quickly	!
Why	did	you	stay	here	?
I	am	asking	,	why	?
My	tooth	hurts	.
Get	the	hell	out	!
I	'll	show	you	.
What	did	I	do	?
What	?
I	'll	show	you	.
What	have	I	done	to	you	?
--------------------
I	'll	show	you	.
What	have	I	done	to	you	?
What	have	I	done	to	you	?
What	have	I	done	to	you	?
What	have	I	done	to	you	?
What	for	?
Leave	me	alone	...	!
Are	you	alive	,	or	what	?
It	's	okay	.
It	's	okay	.
--------------------
This	means	you	're	in	captivity	.
Hey	,	you	...
OUR	VALlANT	TROOPS	HELD	THE	FRONT	LlNE	OF	THE	ENEMY	,
HAVlNG	SElZED	RlCH	BOOTY	AND	PRlSONERS	.
You	scoundrels	,	betrayers	of	Jesus	,	you	're	all	around	here	...	you	have	to	be	shot	.
You	dirty	Russian	pigs	.
You	will	have	to	pay	the	price	for	all	of	us	,	you	no-	good	bums	.
To	the	camp	for	prisoners	of	war	:
Due	to	difficulties	with	food	,	as	of	today	prisoners	of	war	are	permitted	to	leave	the	camp	and	go	into	the	city	to	look	for	work	from	10	:	00	a	.	m	.	to	7	:	00	p	.	m	.
Signed	by	Colonel	...
--------------------
How	much	is	the	watch	?
No	,	no	,	how	...	how	much	?
What	time	is	it	?
What	time	is	it	,	sir	?
7	:	00	.
It	's	7	:	00	already	.
I	have	to	get	back	to	the	base	.
They	lock	it	at	7	:	30	.
After	work	,	we	can	go	to	town	,	but	we	have	to	be	back	on	time	.
I	asked	for	work	all	over	town	.
--------------------
I	am	a	shoemaker	.
Do	you	understand	?
But	everybody	tells	me	,	"	We	don	't	have	any	work	for	Germans	"	.
Russian	soldiers	at	the	front	were	not	as	hostile	as	the	people	here	in	town	.
Do	you	understand	?
You	look	a	lot	like	my	little	sister	,	but	she	's	shorter	than	you	.
I	haven	't	heard	from	her	in	a	long	time	.
I	think	my	little	brother	will	soon	have	to	join	up	.
I	hope	he	doesn	't	end	up	on	the	Western	Front	,	but	in	Russia	instead	.
That	's	better	than	Verdun	.
--------------------
Do	you	understand	?
No	,	I	don	't	understand	.
It	's	okay	.
I	have	to	go	.
It	's	late	.
Goodbye	.
Who	's	here	?
Keep	it	down	,	for	God	's	sake	.
It	's	okay	.
Keep	it	down	.
--------------------
Would	you	like	to	eat	?
With	great	pleasure	.
With	great	pleasure	.
What	?
What	?
"	With	great	pleasure	.
Pleasure	"	.
"	With	great	pleasure	"	.
Do	you	speak	German	?
We	had	Robert	Karlovich	,	an	elderly	German	.
--------------------
He	left	a	long	time	ago	.
They	played	checkers	with	my	father	all	the	time	.
He	was	the	one	who	taught	me	.
Why	didn	't	you	tell	me	earlier	you	could	speak	German	?
We	could	have	had	such	a	nice	conversation	coming	back	.
I	thought	you	didn	't	understand	a	word	.
Yes	.
What	,	yes	?
Do	you	have	a	knife	?
Right	away	.
--------------------
Would	you	like	some	tea	?
I	didn	't	come	to	have	tea	.
What	's	the	last	name	of	your	guest	?
Mueller	ill	.
What	?
Mueller	ill	.
Third	...	they	had	three	Muellers	in	their	army	.
Look	,	dear	Third	.
Do	me	a	favor	,	turn	around	and	get	out	.
I	insist	that	you	leave	.
--------------------
Get	out	of	here	.
He	is	a	shoemaker	as	well	.
Get	out	of	here	,	ugly	German	mug	.
He	is	a	shoemaker	as	well	.
It	's	a	shame	,	Alexander	Petrovich	.
Stop	teaching	me	!
I	have	teachers	better	than	you	.
Where	's	the	way	out	?
The	way	out	?
Yes	,	yes	.
--------------------
There	.
Anka	.
Thank	you	for	everything	.
So	long	.
Hey	!
Take	it	out	and	show	it	.
Are	you	a	shoemaker	?
Yes	,	I	am	a	shoemaker	.
You	know	what	?
Let	's	go	.
--------------------
You	'll	work	for	me	.
I	used	to	work	from	home	as	well	.
Let	's	go	,	let	's	go	.
You	shouldn	't	cry	now	.
Now	we	're	in	war	,	and	before	we	win	...	we	can	't	feel	sorry	for	our	enemies	.
You	should	be	with	us	body	and	soul	.
We	are	doing	the	right	thing	.
Hello	,	hello	.
Maybe	you	'd	like	some	tea	?
I	don	't	feel	like	it	.
--------------------
Why	is	he	here	?
Listen	,	give	me	the	horse	.
Have	you	seen	my	folks	?
No	,	I	haven	't	.
Go	on	,	sew	.
Boy	,	what	's	wrong	with	you	?
Master	,	his	legs	are	broken	.
What	a	hell	.
Master	,	what	should	we	do	now	?
If	he	dies	,	I	'll	die	,	too	.
--------------------
Why	are	you	talking	about	the	horse	and	yourself	,	when	all	of	Russia	is	crying	?
The	entire	Russian	nation	doesn	't	spare	the	power	and	lives	of	its	best	sons	in	the	great	heroic	war	to	defend	our	Motherland	.
Russia	will	come	out	of	that	great	struggle	revitalized	and	strengthened	.
It	's	not	the	time	for	despair	,	when	our	hearts	are	full	of	joy	,	and	the	idea	of	victory	near	.
The	victory	is	close	,	victory	only	.
Hit	the	Germans	,	defeat	the	Germans	...	complete	and	definite	victory	.
We	'll	get	you	out	of	this	dirty	hole	.
There	is	no	other	way	.
Mail	.
You	've	got	mail	.
--------------------
"	To	Peter	Ivan	Gadkin	"	...	for	me	.
"	Dear	Peter	Ivanovich	,	with	deep	sympathy	,	we	inform	you	that	your	older	son	,	Nikolai	Petrovich	,	is	in	the	hospital	with	minor	injuries	and	your	younger	son	,	Semyon	Petrovich	,	was	killed	during	an	attack	"	.
#	When	the	soldiers	march	through	town	#
#	The	girls	will	open	windows	and	doors	...	#
Stop	singing	.
I	told	you	to	stop	!
What	did	you	do	?
Get	out	!
Get	out	of	here	!
Get	out	!
--------------------
Get	out	of	here	!
I	'm	talking	to	you	.
Get	out	.
Hit	the	Germans	!
Beat	the	Germans	!
Beat	him	!
Beat	the	Germans	!
Stop	,	scoundrels	.
So	what	if	he	is	German	?
He	's	still	a	shoemaker	like	us	.
--------------------
What	do	you	want	?
You	should	disperse	.
Go	,	go	.
My	Senka	was	killed	.
Take	him	to	the	bed	.
Move	,	move	.
He	's	not	permitted	to	go	out	anymore	,	since	it	causes	a	big	ruckus	.
Go	away	,	go	away	.
Pick	him	up	.
Anka	,	come	home	,	you	brat	!
--------------------
I	was	knocked	down	...	simply	because	I	'm	German	.
Then	a	girl	came	,	she	was	nice	to	me	.
If	it	hadn	't	been	for	her	,	they	would	have	killed	me	.
Compatriots	,	have	you	heard	?
Our	Tsar	has	abdicated	.
You	're	lying	.
Who	's	lying	?
What	a	rush	!
What	a	rush	!
Brothers	,	friends	,	citizens	...	the	rising	sun	of	revolution	has	destroyed	the	tyranny	.
--------------------
Hello	,	Alexander	Feodorovich	.
I	don	't	have	time	,	I	don	't	have	time	.
I	greet	you	on	behalf	of	the	Provisional	Government	.
Free	citizens	of	free	Russia	,	hurrah	!
Now	the	Duma	of	people	will	govern	.
Duma	...
To	hell	with	the	Tsar	.
We	can	assume	that	there	will	be	no	war	anymore	.
We	can	assume	that	from	the	landowners	...	the	land	...
What	a	rush	!
--------------------
War	is	over	.
The	land	will	be	...
Attack	.
Well	...	okay	,	attack	.
Fire	,	fire	!
Brothers	...	when	will	this	be	over	?
Don	't	save	me	.
I	have	a	wife	and	child	at	home	.
I	think	he	doesn	't	want	to	fight	.
No	,	he	doesn	't	.
--------------------
Explain	to	me	,	my	dear	...	we	don	't	want	to	fight	,	they	don	't	want	to	fight	,	but	still	,	this	is	the	fourth	year	that	we	've	been	fighting	.
Where	are	you	going	,	Nikolai	?
Let	me	talk	.
Every	scoundrel	,	German	agent	,
Bolshevik	,	spy	and	traitor	,	is	appealing	for	fraternization	on	the	front	.
At	this	very	moment	,	when	the	country	,	covered	in	blood	,	is	fighting	against	the	external	enemies	,	the	Bolsheviks	betray	the	Motherland	.
The	Bolsheviks	disintegrate	the	army	.
On	behalf	of	the	Provisional	Government	,	I	declare	...
Shoot	those	scoundrels	!
Don	't	disturb	me	,	let	me	talk	.
--------------------
On	behalf	of	the	Provisional	Government	,	I	declare	,	with	no	mercy	,	we	will	destroy	soldiers	,	traitors	calling	for	fraternization	and	disintegration	of	the	army	.
Nikolai	!
Nikolai	!
Nikolai	!
Artillery	,	shoot	the	traitor	of	the	Motherland	.
Shoot	!
My	dear	Nikolai	...
Don	't	give	rifles	to	the	commanders	.
Deputies	,	soldiers	...	the	Winter	Palace	has	been	captured	.
Anka	!
--------------------
Sit	down	and	play	!
Stop	!
What	's	the	matter	?
We	've	arrived	,	get	off	.
Go	to	hell	!
I	told	you	,	we	've	arrived	!
I	won	't	get	off	.
We	kindly	request	you	to	get	off	.
I	'm	submitting	to	violence	.
As	you	should	!
--------------------
Peter	,	arrest	him	!
Get	up	.
Get	up	.
Get	up	,	Kolya	.
Kolechka	.
Kolechka	!
Kolya	.
What	do	you	want	?
Get	up	.
Now	.
--------------------
What	a	rush	!

Alexander	Feodorovich	!
How	long	will	it	last	?
Will	what	last	?
The	strike	.
God	knows	!
--------------------
So	,	that	's	the	situation	.
And	who	is	Alexander	Feodorovich	?
Our	new	tenant	.
Social	revolutionary	democrat	...	a	striker	.
He	is	one	of	those	who	organized	a	strike	in	1905	.
And	this	one	as	well	.
Look	,	he	went	somewhere	again	.
Daddy	.
Daddy	.
Something	happened	.
--------------------
What	do	you	want	?
Get	up	,	Senka	.
Sen.
You	sleep	like	hell	.

Let	's	go	,	let	's	go	.
I	'm	talking	to	you	.
Guten	Morgen	,	Robert	Karlovich	.
Hello	,	Alexander	Petrovich	.
Hey	,	Robert	Karlovich	,	shouldn	't	we	go	get	some	beer	?
Alexander	Petrovich	,	don	't	you	know	what	is	whistling	over	there	?
They	are	whistling	.
Maybe	something	has	happened	.
Let	's	go	have	a	look	and	get	some	beer	on	our	way	.
With	a	great	pleasure	,	Alexander	Petrovich	.
--------------------
I	am	getting	ready	.
What	's	going	on	,	Robert	Karlovich	?
Where	is	my	hat	?
One	minute	.
Try	this	on	.
What	do	you	think	,	Alexander	Petrovich	?

What	are	you	saying	,	Alexander	Petrovich	?
I	'm	saying	that	we	've	got	it	won	.
You	won	't	win	,	Alexander	Petrovich	,	we	can	fight	pretty	well	.
You	know	me	.
We	have	always	fought	together	for	your	rights	.
And	you	have	trusted	me	and	you	should	trust	me	again	.
--------------------
Now	,	in	this	fateful	moment	when	the	Germans	have	conquered	our	borders	...	what	should	we	do	?
You	should	look	for	the	answer	to	this	question	in	the	heart	of	the	Russian	man	.
In	the	face	of	the	external	enemy	,	let	's	forget	internal	class	strife	and	stop	the	strike	.
Let	's	bravely	go	to	battle	believing	in	victory	.
Go	to	battle	!
What	are	you	doing	?
What	are	you	doing	?
I	am	asking	you	.
I	'll	go	.
Where	will	you	go	?
--------------------
He	won	't	go	anywhere	.
No	,	I	'll	go	.
Where	will	you	go	?
Volunteer	.
If	I	said	so	,	it	means	I	'll	go	.
I	'm	telling	you	,	I	'll	go	.
I	'm	telling	you	,	I	'll	go	.
What	are	you	doing	?
You	're	taking	everything	with	you	.
I	'm	telling	you	,	let	me	go	!
--------------------
Wait	.
Cowards	.
I	'll	show	you	!
You	're	not	going	anywhere	!
Cowards	,	I	told	you	to	let	me	go	!
What	a	fool	.
So	,	Petrovich	,
I	am	leaving	my	horse	with	you	.
Take	care	of	it	.
I	'll	pay	you	when	I	return	.
--------------------
If	I	don	't	return	,	keep	it	.
It	's	war	.
Band	together	,	brothers	!
They	want	to	enslave	and	destroy	us	.
For	our	Father	Tsar	,	for	our	Motherland	,	for	Orthodox	faith	,	let	's	fight	.
All	of	us	will	go	for	the	purpose	of	...
Lord	,	bless	us	to	win	.
Hurrah	.

What	have	I	done	to	you	?
What	for	?
Leave	me	alone	...	!
Are	you	alive	,	or	what	?
It	's	okay	.
--------------------
It	's	okay	.
This	means	you	're	in	captivity	.
Hey	,	you	...
OUR	VALlANT	TROOPS	HELD	THE	FRONT	LlNE	OF	THE	ENEMY	,

You	dirty	Russian	pigs	.
You	will	have	to	pay	the	price	for	all	of	us	,	you	no-	good	bums	.
To	the	camp	for	prisoners	of	war	:
Due	to	difficulties	with	food	,	as	of	today	prisoners	of	war	are	permitted	to	leave	the	camp	and	go	into	the	city	to	look	for	work	from	10	:	00	a	.	m	.	to	7	:	00	p	.	m	.

What	time	is	it	,	sir	?
7	:	00	.
It	's	7	:	00	already	.
I	have	to	get	back	to	the	base	.
They	lock	it	at	7	:	30	.
After	work	,	we	can	go	to	town	,	but	we	have	to	be	back	on	time	.

I	asked	for	work	all	over	town	.
I	am	a	shoemaker	.
Do	you	understand	?
But	everybody	tells	me	,	"	We	don	't	have	any	work	for	Germans	"	.

Who	's	here	?
Keep	it	down	,	for	God	's	sake	.
It	's	okay	.
--------------------
Keep	it	down	.
Would	you	like	to	eat	?
With	great	pleasure	.
With	great	pleasure	.
What	?
What	?
"	With	great	pleasure	.
Pleasure	"	.
"	With	great	pleasure	"	.
Do	you	speak	German	?
--------------------
We	had	Robert	Karlovich	,	an	elderly	German	.
He	left	a	long	time	ago	.
They	played	checkers	with	my	father	all	the	time	.
He	was	the	one	who	taught	me	.
Why	didn	't	you	tell	me	earlier	you	could	speak	German	?
We	could	have	had	such	a	nice	conversation	coming	back	.
I	thought	you	didn	't	understand	a	word	.
Yes	.
What	,	yes	?
Do	you	have	a	knife	?
--------------------
Right	away	.
Would	you	like	some	tea	?
I	didn	't	come	to	have	tea	.
What	's	the	last	name	of	your	guest	?
Mueller	ill	.
What	?
Mueller	ill	.
Third	...	they	had	three	Muellers	in	their	army	.
Look	,	dear	Third	.
Do	me	a	favor	,	turn	around	and	get	out	.
--------------------
I	insist	that	you	leave	.
Get	out	of	here	.
He	is	a	shoemaker	as	well	.
Get	out	of	here	,	ugly	German	mug	.
He	is	a	shoemaker	as	well	.
It	's	a	shame	,	Alexander	Petrovich	.
Stop	teaching	me	!
I	have	teachers	better	than	you	.
Where	's	the	way	out	?
The	way	out	?
--------------------
Yes	,	yes	.
There	.
Anka	.
Thank	you	for	everything	.
So	long	.
Hey	!
Take	it	out	and	show	it	.
Are	you	a	shoemaker	?
Yes	,	I	am	a	shoemaker	.
You	know	what	?
--------------------
Let	's	go	.
You	'll	work	for	me	.
I	used	to	work	from	home	as	well	.
Let	's	go	,	let	's	go	.
You	shouldn	't	cry	now	.
Now	we	're	in	war	,	and	before	we	win	...	we	can	't	feel	sorry	for	our	enemies	.
You	should	be	with	us	body	and	soul	.
We	are	doing	the	right	thing	.
Hello	,	hello	.
Maybe	you	'd	like	some	tea	?
--------------------
I	don	't	feel	like	it	.
Why	is	he	here	?
Listen	,	give	me	the	horse	.
Have	you	seen	my	folks	?
No	,	I	haven	't	.
Go	on	,	sew	.
Boy	,	what	's	wrong	with	you	?
Master	,	his	legs	are	broken	.
What	a	hell	.
Master	,	what	should	we	do	now	?
--------------------
If	he	dies	,	I	'll	die	,	too	.
Why	are	you	talking	about	the	horse	and	yourself	,	when	all	of	Russia	is	crying	?
The	entire	Russian	nation	doesn	't	spare	the	power	and	lives	of	its	best	sons	in	the	great	heroic	war	to	defend	our	Motherland	.
Russia	will	come	out	of	that	great	struggle	revitalized	and	strengthened	.
It	's	not	the	time	for	despair	,	when	our	hearts	are	full	of	joy	,	and	the	idea	of	victory	near	.
The	victory	is	close	,	victory	only	.
Hit	the	Germans	,	defeat	the	Germans	...	complete	and	definite	victory	.
We	'll	get	you	out	of	this	dirty	hole	.
There	is	no	other	way	.
Mail	.
--------------------
You	've	got	mail	.
"	To	Peter	Ivan	Gadkin	"	...	for	me	.
"	Dear	Peter	Ivanovich	,	with	deep	sympathy	,	we	inform	you	that	your	older	son	,	Nikolai	Petrovich	,	is	in	the	hospital	with	minor	injuries	and	your	younger	son	,	Semyon	Petrovich	,	was	killed	during	an	attack	"	.
#	When	the	soldiers	march	through	town	#
#	The	girls	will	open	windows	and	doors	...	#
Stop	singing	.
I	told	you	to	stop	!
What	did	you	do	?
Get	out	!
Get	out	of	here	!
--------------------
Get	out	!
Get	out	of	here	!
I	'm	talking	to	you	.
Get	out	.
Hit	the	Germans	!
Beat	the	Germans	!
Beat	him	!
Beat	the	Germans	!
Stop	,	scoundrels	.
So	what	if	he	is	German	?
--------------------
He	's	still	a	shoemaker	like	us	.
What	do	you	want	?
You	should	disperse	.
Go	,	go	.
My	Senka	was	killed	.
Take	him	to	the	bed	.
Move	,	move	.
He	's	not	permitted	to	go	out	anymore	,	since	it	causes	a	big	ruckus	.
Go	away	,	go	away	.
Pick	him	up	.
--------------------
Anka	,	come	home	,	you	brat	!
I	was	knocked	down	...	simply	because	I	'm	German	.
Then	a	girl	came	,	she	was	nice	to	me	.
If	it	hadn	't	been	for	her	,	they	would	have	killed	me	.
Compatriots	,	have	you	heard	?
Our	Tsar	has	abdicated	.
You	're	lying	.
Who	's	lying	?
What	a	rush	!
What	a	rush	!
--------------------
Brothers	,	friends	,	citizens	...	the	rising	sun	of	revolution	has	destroyed	the	tyranny	.
Hello	,	Alexander	Feodorovich	.
I	don	't	have	time	,	I	don	't	have	time	.
I	greet	you	on	behalf	of	the	Provisional	Government	.
Free	citizens	of	free	Russia	,	hurrah	!
Now	the	Duma	of	people	will	govern	.
Duma	...
To	hell	with	the	Tsar	.
We	can	assume	that	there	will	be	no	war	anymore	.
We	can	assume	that	from	the	landowners	...	the	land	...
--------------------
What	a	rush	!
War	is	over	.
The	land	will	be	...
Attack	.
Well	...	okay	,	attack	.
Fire	,	fire	!
Brothers	...	when	will	this	be	over	?
Don	't	save	me	.
I	have	a	wife	and	child	at	home	.
I	think	he	doesn	't	want	to	fight	.
--------------------
No	,	he	doesn	't	.
Explain	to	me	,	my	dear	...	we	don	't	want	to	fight	,	they	don	't	want	to	fight	,	but	still	,	this	is	the	fourth	year	that	we	've	been	fighting	.
Where	are	you	going	,	Nikolai	?
Let	me	talk	.
Every	scoundrel	,	German	agent	,
Bolshevik	,	spy	and	traitor	,	is	appealing	for	fraternization	on	the	front	.
At	this	very	moment	,	when	the	country	,	covered	in	blood	,	is	fighting	against	the	external	enemies	,	the	Bolsheviks	betray	the	Motherland	.
The	Bolsheviks	disintegrate	the	army	.
On	behalf	of	the	Provisional	Government	,	I	declare	...
Shoot	those	scoundrels	!
--------------------
Don	't	disturb	me	,	let	me	talk	.
On	behalf	of	the	Provisional	Government	,	I	declare	,	with	no	mercy	,	we	will	destroy	soldiers	,	traitors	calling	for	fraternization	and	disintegration	of	the	army	.
Nikolai	!
Nikolai	!
Nikolai	!
Artillery	,	shoot	the	traitor	of	the	Motherland	.
Shoot	!
My	dear	Nikolai	...
Don	't	give	rifles	to	the	commanders	.
Deputies	,	soldiers	...	the	Winter	Palace	has	been	captured	.
--------------------
Anka	!
Sit	down	and	play	!
Stop	!
What	's	the	matter	?
We	've	arrived	,	get	off	.
Go	to	hell	!
I	told	you	,	we	've	arrived	!
I	won	't	get	off	.
We	kindly	request	you	to	get	off	.
I	'm	submitting	to	violence	.
--------------------
As	you	should	!
Peter	,	arrest	him	!
Get	up	.
Get	up	.
Get	up	,	Kolya	.
Kolechka	.
Kolechka	!
Kolya	.
What	do	you	want	?
Get	up	.
--------------------
Now	.
What	a	rush	!
THE	END
Originally	124	minutes	long	,	the	film	had	been	banned	in	Germany	.
It	wasn	't	until	August	24	,	1951	,	that	the	movie	was	first	shown	in	Germany	in	a	shortened	111	-	minute	version	.
The	original	negative	of	that	version	survived	at	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	but	was	severely	damaged	.
Therefore	,	a	1951	duplicate	positive	from	the	collection	of	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	served	as	a	basis	for	the	restoration	.
Whenever	possible	,	missing	scenes	from	the	Federal	Film	Archive	and	the	Munich	Film	Museum	were	inserted	.
In	its	present	form	,	the	film	runs	121	minutes	.
The	film	was	restored	by	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	in	collaboration	with	the	Federal	Film	Archive	,	the	Munich	Film	Museum	,

You	know	that	one	,	Müiler	?
Those	are	the	girls	who	carry	dead	police	inspectors	directly	up	to	heaven	from	the	Alexanderplatz	with	a	"	Hey	ho	.	"
On	horseback	.
Horseback	?
Certainly	.
Expenses	don	't	allow	for	a	car	.
--------------------
Well	,	Inspector	,	when	it	comes	to	corpses	,	the	state	sometimes	has	...	a	fit	of	generosity	.
That	's	what	you	think	.
Believe	it	or	not	,	Müiler	,	tonight	will	be	the	first	time
I	make	it	to	the	theater	in	time	for	the	first	act	.
Knock	on	wood	,	Inspector	.
There	.
What	did	I	tell	you	?
Tell	'em	I	'm	dead	.
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
--------------------
Inspector	.
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Hofmeister	would	like	to	speak	with	you	,	Inspector	.
What	?
Our	former	colleague	who	got	into	trouble	with	foreign	currency	?
That	scoundrel	?
Tell	him	his	call	is	the	most	shameless	affront
I	've	ever	experienced	!
And	tell	him	to	go	to	hell	!
--------------------
I	'm	sorry	,	but	Inspector	Lohmann	has	already	left	and	he	says	you
And	he	says	you	can	go	to	hell	!
God	help	me	!
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	Müiler	.
I	once	had	high	hopes	for	that	fellow	Hofmeister	.
I	gave	him	his	first	chance	.
And	what	does	the	scoundrel	do	?
He	takes	a	bribe	from	a	black-	market	currency	trader	.
Phooey	!
The	man	I	would	have	staked	my	life	for	disgraces	me	by	getting	fired	from	the	service
--------------------
like	a	bad	egg	.
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
He	has	to	hear	me	out	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Tell	him	it	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	,	I	think	you	really	ought	to
Of	course	I	'll	miss	the	first	act	again	!
I	want	to	redeem	myself	in	his	eyes	!
I	finally	figured	out	their	scheme	.
It	's	a	monstrous	business	!
--------------------
They	've	nearly	done	me	in	three	times	!
I	hardly	dare	cross	the	street	!
Lohmann	speaking	.
What	is	it	?
Inspector	?
Thank	you	.
Cut	out	the	nonsense	and	tell	me	what	's	wrong	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
I	've	finally	discovered
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
--------------------
Just	in	case	,	Inspector	,	please	have	a	record	made	of	my	report	.
Headphones	.
Take	this	down	.
I	was	actually	tracing	counterfeit	money	.
I	wanted	to	redeem	myself	in	your	eyes	,	Inspector	.
For	four	days	-	96	hours
I	lay	up	there	at	the	air	vent	,	and	now	I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	.
But	you	'll	probably	think	I	'm	crazy	.
Who	is	it	?
I	swear	I	'm	telling	the	truth	.
--------------------
I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	!
I	heard	his	name	with	my	own	ears	!
And	now	they	know	I	know	the	name	.
Can	you	trace	that	call	?
For	God	's	sake	!
Hofmeister	!
What	street	?
Number	23	?
Thanks	.
Dear	God	.
--------------------
He	must	have	gone	out	of	his	mind	from	terror	.
A	pathological	condition	that	is	not	as	rare	as	one	might	suspect	.
Exposure	to	catastrophes	such	as	explosions	,	earthquakes	and	railway	accidents	-	in	short	,	exposure	to	fright	and	horror	often	triggers	insanity	.
Perhaps	the	most	interesting	case	of	such	pathological	conditions	is	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Here	he	goes	again	.
I	shall	briefly	recount	the	history	of	this	case	.
The	patient	lived	a	decidedly	double	life	.
He	was	a	renowned	doctor	with	a	large	private	practice	.
Aided	by	an	almost	superhuman	logic	,	he	used	his	profound	knowledge	of	hypnosis	to	commit	crimes	of	a	magnitude	previously	deemed	impossible	.
For	months	the	police	sought	the	mastermind	behind	those	crimes	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	.
--------------------
At	last	they	discovered	his	whereabouts	.
But	Mabuse	decided	not	to	flee	but	rather	to	mount	armed	resistance	,	and	he	barricaded	himself	in	his	house	with	four	loyal	henchmen	.
He	refused	demands	to	surrender	to	state	authorities	,	saying	,
"	I	am	the	state	!	"
A	barrage	of	bullets	forced	the	police	to	retreat	.
Finally	,	soldiers	stormed	the	house	with	hand	grenades	.
Two	of	the	defenders	were	killed	.
Two	were	captured	.
Mabuse	,	however	,	had	disappeared	.
One	prisoner	revealed	his	hiding	place	:	a	counterfeiting	lab	from	which	he	planned	to	launch	a	massive	attack	on	the	German	currency	system	.
--------------------
Two	years	ago	,	however	,	certain	words	began	to	appear	on	the	paper	.
Then	,	sentences	began	to	form	,	still	meaningless	and	confused	.
Gradually	they	grew	more	coherent	and	logical	,	and	at	last	we	began	to	get	glimpses	into	the	extraordinary	phenomenon	that	was	his	mind	.
His	thoughts	still	move	in	the	same	criminal	channels	as	before	.
Whatever	Mabuse	writes	is	based	upon	incontrovertible	logic	and	serves	as	a	perfect	guide	for	the	commission	of	crimes	worked	out	to	the	minutest	detail	.
No	.
Nothing	can	happen	to	us	if	we	follow	the	doctor	's	methods	.
Oh	,	yeah	?
What	do	you	mean	,	"	oh	,	yeah	"	?
The	first	attacks	on	the	snitch	failed	.
--------------------
So	what	?
Tough	luck	.
So	we	called	in	Division	2-	B	to	handle	the	matter	.
If	they	succeed	,	fine	.
And	if	they	don	't	-	if	it	looks	like	that	snitch	might	rat	on	us	-	one	single	phone	call	and	this	whole	place	gets	blown	sky-	high	.
Stop	scratching	,	Fritzi	.
It	won	't	come	to	that	.
Before	that	guy	can	open	his	mouth	,	he	'll	be	done	for	.
I	'd	feel	better	if	they	didn	't	resort	to	murder	.
What	do	you	mean	,	murder	?
--------------------
A	guy	can	have	something	fall	on	his	head	,	can	't	he	?
A	nice	,	clean	little	accident	.
I	don	't	care	how	you	make	it	look	.
I	just	don	't	want	anything	to	do	with	murder	.
Scared	?
Can	't	bear	the	sight	of	blood	?
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	though	it	's	really	none	of	your	damn	business	.
I	've	killed	two	people	.
I	know	what	it	means	to	kill	.
And	that	's	precisely	why
--------------------
I	want	nothing	to	do	with	murder	.
Leave	him	alone	,	Fritzi	.
What	do	you	know	about	Kent	?
The	phone	!
Yeah	?
It	's	been	taken	care	of	?
Bravo	!
Really	?
Just	20	minutes	later	?
Lohmann	himself	?
--------------------
Continue	writing	.
Hofmeister	himself	has	disappeared	.
The	rug	has	been	moved	toward	the	window	.
He	was	on	the	phone	when	the	lights	went	out	.
Where	's	the	light	switch	?
Here	by	the	door	.
So	it	came	from	over	there	,	the	unknown	horror	,	the	thing	that	caused	his	mind	to	snap	.
And	he	backed	away	from	it	step	by	step	,	right	up	to	the	window	.
I	wonder	if	he
No	,	he	couldn	't	get	out	this	way	.
--------------------
Certainly	not	downward	.
Well	,	I	'll	be	damned	!
Actual	letters	scratched	into	the	glass	with	a	ring	.
So	he	was	trying	to	tell	me	something	.
Is	that	a	W	?
No	.
Could	it	be	a	name	?
It	may	take	us	a	while	to	figure	that	one	out	.
Hey	,	Krüger	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
Take	this	pane	of	glass	to	my	office	at	headquarters	.
And	see	that	you	don	't	break	it	,	or	I	'll	bite	your	head	off	.
That	's	odd	.
I	wonder	what	's	behind	that	.
Thirty	pages	today	,	Professor	.
Thank	you	.
Keep	a	careful	eye	on	him	tonight	.
I	don	't	like	his	pulse	.
In	any	case	,	give	him	a	shot	later	so	he	can	get	some	rest	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
--------------------
Their	famous	chocolate	shake	?
And	a	double	mocha	for	you	,	sir	?
With	hot	cream	.
As	usual	.
Very	well	.
And	now	tell	me	,	Tom	.
Why	did	you	ask	to	see	me	so	urgently	today	?
Don	't	you	know	what	today	is	,	Lilli	?
Today	?
Too	bad	.
--------------------
Won	't	you	tell	me	?
Certainly	.
A	chocolate	shake	and	a	double	mocha	with	hot	cream	.
Well	,	Tom	?
You	ask	what	day	this	is	?
Exactly	one	year	ago	today	,
No	smoking	,	gentlemen	.
Smoking	is	prohibited	.
Good	heavens	,	my	friend	,	are	you	back	again	?
I	've	told	you	a	hundred	times	there	's	no	point	in	coming	every	day	.
--------------------
When	we	have	work	for	you	,	we	'll	certainly	notify	you	.
I	've	been	waiting	for	three	months	!
Be	reasonable	.
Reasonable	?
What	does	reasonable	mean	when	a	man	is	going	under	?
I	want	to	work	!
But	they	keep	pushing	me	closer	to	the	edge	!
It	's	enough	to	drive	a	man	to	crime	!
He	's	forced	to	become	a	criminal	!
He	marches	in	here	and	causes	a	riot	!
--------------------
Don	't	get	so	worked	up	.
We	have	others	to	attend	to	.
Come	now	.
Leave	him	alone	.
He	's	sick	.
Come	now	.
Don	't	touch	me	!
I	'll	go	on	my	own	!
You	'll	never	see	me	again	here	!
Next	,	please	.
--------------------
You	've	seen	the	last	of	me	!
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
I	can	't	bear	to	see	you	leave	like	this	.
Here	are	20	marks	.
It	's	all	I	have	right	now	,	but	I	'd	like	you	to	have	it	.
It	may	help	you	out	.
I	don	't	want	charity	.
I	want	work	,	not	a	handout	.
It	's	not	a	handout	.
It	's	just	a	loan	.
--------------------
I	'm	sure	you	'll	be	able	to	pay	me	back	.
Please	.
Yes	.
And	six	months	later	,	you	found	work	and	promptly	paid	back	my	20	marks	.
Tell	me	,	Lilli	...
have	you	ever	been	in	love	?
It	's	high	time	I	was	going	.
Here	comes	my	bus	.
Please	stay	.
I	can	't	.
--------------------
I	've	got	to	run	.
Good-	bye	,	Tom	.
Call	me	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
If	you	'll	be	seated	,	Doctor	,	the	professor	is	due	back	any	moment	.
Thanks	,	Winkler	.
I	'm	sure	I	'll	find	what	I	need	.
Ah	,	I	see	it	's	on	his	desk	.
Oops	.
--------------------
Oh	,	dear	!
What	order	does	all	this	go	in	?
This	junk	isn	't	even	numbered	.
What	is	this	anyway	?
NOTES	BY	DR.	MABUSE	SEPTEMBER	1	ST	-	OCTOBER	31	ST
How	does	this	go	together	now	?
No	,	the	other	way	around	.
Then	this	page	.
What	's	the	next	part	?
"	Jewel	-	"
--------------------
No	.
"	Jewel
ry	store	.	"
"	Jewelry	store	...	specializing	in	high-	quality	...	"
What	?
"	The	least	conspicuous	and	therefore	most	effective	precaution	to	prevent	interruption	by	police	,	pedestrians	and	clients	is	to	pull	the	shades	and	hang	a	sign	on	the	door	:
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
Well	,	I	'll	be	!
"	The	criminals	then	lowered	the	shades	and	hung	a	sign	outside	the	door	,
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
--------------------
If	that	isn	't	something	!
That	's	incredible	!
"	lmmobilize	the	staff	by	using	gas	in	bulbs	of	thin	glass	,	which	will	burst	almost	inaudibly	when	tossed	.	"
Gas	!
Amazing	!
Identical	,	almost	to	the	word	!
"	The	criminals	appear	to	have	tossed	bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
"	Bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
If	that	isn	't	odd	!
It	's	as	if	they	were	following	a	blueprint	!
--------------------
What	are	you	doing	there	?
Baum	.
This	is	the	most	incredible	thing	you	could	imagine	.
Look	here	.
What	is	this	?
Where	did	you	get	these	papers	?
Never	mind	that	!
You	know	what	they	are	?
Yes	,	of	course	.
Now	read	this	.
--------------------
"	Ingenious	jewelry	heist	...	"
That	's	right	.
Read	it	.
"	Jewelry	stolen	valued	at	250,	000	marks	.
Gas	was	used	on	the	employees	.	"
Yes	,	just	as	if	they	were	following	your	Dr.	Mabuse	's	instructions	.
A	curious	coincidence	.
Now	wait	just	a	minute	.
You	call	that	a	coincidence	?
What	else	?
--------------------
Baum	,	old	man	,	coincidences	like	that	just	don	't	happen	.
There	's	some	connection	in	all	this	or	I	'll	eat	my	hat	.
Say	,	I	've	got	a	crazy	idea	.
Could	this	Mabuse	fellow	be	faking	it	?
Maybe	the	guy	isn	't	insane	after	all	.
Tell	me	,	do	you	think	that	,	after	treating	a	patient	for	years	,
I	can	't	judge	whether	he	's	really	sick	or	just	pretending	?
I	didn	't	mean	it	like	that	.
But	there	must	be	something	behind	all	this	.
You	know	what	a	genius	this	fellow	was	.
--------------------
It	's	just	possible	that	his	dead	brain	has	come	back	to	life	.
Couldn	't	Mabuse	be	writing	these	things	as	a	sort	of	blueprint	for	a	gang	of	accomplices	?
You	've	always	had	a	wild	imagination	.
Just	hear	me	out	.
What	if	Mabuse	,	with	his	incredible	hypnotic	powers	,	engaged	in	some	kind	of	telepathic	hypnosis	from	his	cell	?
Nonsense	!
Nonsense	?
Say	what	you	like	,	but	there	's	something	weird	going	on	!
Who	else	besides	you	knows	about	Mabuse	's	notes	?
You	sound	just	like	a	policeman	.
--------------------
I	think	the	police	should	be	informed	of	this	strange	coincidence	.
The	police	?
Of	course	!
Well	,	perhaps
Of	course	you	're	right	.
The	police	would	want	to	know	of	this	.
Of	course	!
I	'll	go	to	them	at	once	.
If	I	can	,	I	'll	call	you	from	the	station	.
Good-	bye	.
--------------------
Please	drive	carefully	,	Doctor	.
It	's	been	raining	.
Thank	you	,	Winkler	.
Good-	bye	.

Almost	a	quarter	million	in	jewels	.

Can	?
--------------------
Could	!
But	what	will	be	done	with	it	?
What	's	gonna	happen	with	that	quarter	million	?
Careful	.
I	ask	you
Will	you	stay	down	?
What	becomes	of	it	,	I	ask	you	?
We	buy	cocaine	with	it	,	morphine	,	heroin	,	opium	,	whatever	you	call	all	that	crap	.
And	instead	of	making	a	killing	off	the	dope	and	fleecing	the	types	who	are	crazy	for	the	stuff	,	they	practically	give	it	away	.
What	good	does	it	do	the	boss	to	pump	the	world	full	of	dope	and	not	make	any	money	off	it	?
--------------------
These	things	won	't	stay	down	.
What	does	it	get	him	?
I	follow	his	instructions	and	drive	ten	people	nearly	crazy	with	threats	and	blackmail	.
And	when	they	're	ready	to	pay	any	sum	we	ask	,	then	I	'm	told	to	back	off	and	forget	about	the	money	.
Only	result	is	they	're	driven	crazy	from	fear	of	a	scandal	.
Is	that	any	business	of	yours	,	old	boy	?
Did	you	ever	fail	to	get	your	pay	on	time	?
That	's	not	what	I	'm	saying	.
Okay	,	then	.
You	handle	the	blackmail	,	and	I	see	to	your	alibi	.
--------------------
We	get	our	paychecks	like	clockwork	,	so	what	are	you	growling	about	?
I	'm	not	growling	.
I	just	don	't	get	it	.
If	a	woman	throws	herself	out	the	window	,	or	a	fellow	blows	his	brains	out	,	like	that	bank	director	,	blackmail	letters	aren	't	of	much	use	.
150	grand	tossed	in	the	gutter	.
Is	there	any	sense	in	that	?
Or	take	the	new	instructions	about	the	explosives	,	and	stealing	poison	from	drugstores	-	that	's	scary	business	.
As	it	's	meant	to	be	,	my	dear	fellow	.
But	why	,	in	the	devil	's	name	?
I	think	you	ask	too	many	questions	.
--------------------
The	boss	doesn	't	like	that	.
What	?
You	know	him	?
No	more	than	you	do	,	or	anyone	else	in	our	gang	.
And	I	'm	not	the	least	bit	curious	.
I	learned	my	lesson	from	your	predecessor	.
He	just	had	to	find	out	what	the	man	looked	like	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	,	the	boss	.
So	one	day	,	without	having	been	summoned	,
Cut	it	out	,	man	.
You	're	spoiling	my	appetite	.
--------------------
Let	me	give	you	a	tip	.
Let	the	boss	worry	about	this	stuff	.
We	're	well	paid	.
In	fact	,	very	well	paid	.
If	something	goes	wrong	,	we	'll	have	cast-	iron	alibis	or	a	top-	notch	lawyer	.
The	boss	thinks	of	everything	and	takes	care	of	everything	and	demands	not	a	penny	for	himself	of	all	the	loot	.
Not	a	penny	.
See	?
That	's	just	it	.
Why	?
--------------------
Why	doesn	't	he	take	a	single	penny	for	himself	?
I	can	't	understand	that	,	and	that	's	what	's	got	me	jumpy	.
Lots	of	others	in	our	gang	probably	feel	the	same	and	would	like	to	be	done	with	the	whole	thing	but	just	don	't	know	how	.
"	Dearest	Lilli	,	you	dashed	off	so	quickly	this	afternoon	that	I	had	no	chance	to	say	what	I	wanted	to	tell	you	.
I	-	"
TONlGHT	AT	1	:	00	A.	M.	-	DR.	MABUSE
Inspector	Lohmann	asks	if	you	had	the	hospitals	searched	.
A	special	squad	did	that	,	and	Hofmeister	hasn	't	been	admitted	anywhere	?
Damn	it	!
You	'll	call	back	?
--------------------
Wait	a	minute	.
Get	a	picture	of	Hofmeister	from	the	files	.
We	may	need	to	have	posters	printed	up	.
Now	,	then	,	what	is	your	assessment	of	the	murder	in	the	automobile	?
So	far	,	all	I	know	is	that	the	killer	used	a	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	,	from	1906	,	production	of	which	ended	in	1916	.
This	weapon	was	fired	from	a	distance	of	not	more	than	25	feet	.
No	empty	shells	were	found	in	the	street	nor	on	the	sidewalk	,	and	the	bullet	's	trajectory	indicates	the	shot	was	not	fired	from	a	window	but	rather	from	a	point	almost	level	with	the	victim	's	head	.
We	may	therefore	conclude	the	shot	was	fired	from	another	vehicle	.
Another	vehicle	?
That	would	be	very	interesting	indeed	.
--------------------
That	opens	up	a	whole	new	perspective	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Not	bad	.
Excuse	me	,	Inspector	.
It	's	Habermann	.
This	is	about	the	Kramm	homicide	.
Inspector	,	we	've	traced	the	murder	victim	's	actions	up	until	6	:	10	on	the	evening	of	the	murder	.
Where	he	was	from	then	until	the	time	of	death	we	have	not	yet	been	able	to	establish	.
But	that	's	what	we	need	to	find	out	.
See	that	you	find	out	where	he	was	those	last	two	hours	.
--------------------
Very	well	.
Müiler	,	arrange	to	have	-	No	,	wait	.
Where	's	the	text	for	the	Kramm	homicide	poster	?
Here	it	is	.
"	All	information	will	be	kept	confidential	"
Put	another	line	in	here	:
"	Especially	concerning	the	hours	from	6	:	00	to	8	:	00	p	.	m	.	"
Have	those	changes	made	.
And	-	No	,	never	mind	.
I	'll	do	it	myself	.

Photo	department	.

I	'm	sure	Hofmeister	intended	to
Inspector	,	they	found	Hofmeister	!
--------------------
Where	?
The	police	station	at	Schöneberger	Ufer	.
A	police	patrol	found	him	.
At	first	they	thought	he	was	just	another	drunk	because	he	kept	babbling	to	himself	incessantly	.
But	then	they	heard	him	call	your	name	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Why	won	't	you	listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	?
Inspector	,	you	must	listen	to	me	.
It	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	Lohmann	,	please	listen	,	for	the	love	of	God	!
--------------------
My	God	!
You	see	?
The	moment	he	thinks	he	's	being	watched	,	he	starts	singing	.
When	he	thinks	he	's	alone	,	he	calls	your	name	.
I	'll	leave	you	alone	now	.
Hofmeister	,	don	't	you	recognize	me	?
Goddamn	it	!
Hofmeister	,	it	's	me	,	Lohmann	.
Your	old	friend	Lohmann	.
My	God	!
--------------------
Inspector	?
Inspector	Lohmann	?
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	?
For	God	's	sake	,	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Come	to	the	phone	!
Hello	.
This	is	Lohmann	.
Detective	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Who	is	it	,	please	?
Inspector	?
--------------------
Is	that	you	,	Hofmeister	?
This	is	Lohmann	.
Hopeless	.
We	'll	have	no	other	choice	but	to	commit	the	poor	devil	to	an	institution	.
Listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	?
Poor	devil	,	eh	?
Heaven	help	me	if	I	ever	get	my	hands	on	the	scoundrel	responsible	for	that	fellow	's	condition	!
All	of	a	sudden	he	stopped	writing	and	just	sat	there	like	a	living	corpse	.
Then	he	suddenly	got	an	expression	in	his	eyes	,
--------------------
If	he	were	in	his	right	mind	,
I	believe	he	could	compel	people	to	do	his	will	right	from	his	cell	.
The	professor	must	come	.
The	professor	is	working	and	doesn	't	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
Winkler	,	this	is	Mabuse	!
Not	so	loud	!
The	professor	will	fire	me	on	the	spot	.

Oh	,	yes	,	I	am	.

You	will	never	know	what	you	've	meant	in	my	botched	life	.

"	Forget	me	-	though	I	shall	never	forget	you	!	"
--------------------
It	spells	Mabuse	.
What	spells	Mabuse	?
Those	scratches	on	the	windowpane	,	Inspector	.
It	took	me	forever	to	discover	he	was	writing	as	if	in	a	mirror	.
Using	his	left	hand	,	and	behind	his	back	.
If	you	flip	it	over	,	see	there	?
Quite	clear	.
Wasn	't	he	that
Quite	right	.

Let	's	see	what	business	he	has	being	on	that	windowpane	.
then	you	may	sweep	up	as	much	as	you	like	.
But	until	then	,	he	'll	go	wild	as	an	ape	if	you	touch	anything	,	and	he	bites	.
I	'd	like	to	see	him	try	.
The	old	man	's	coming	.
Get	out	!

Müiler	,	come	here	.
Call	up	G9-	19-	902	.
That	's	the	mental	hospital	run	by	Professor	Baum	where	they	committed	a	certain	Dr.	Mabuse	.
I	'd	like	to	know	if	he	's	still	there	.
When	?
Thank	you	.
Dr.	Mabuse	died	this	morning	.
This	morning	?
Today	of	all	days	.
That	is	quite	peculiar	.

TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
So	,	you	too	?
What	do	you	mean	,	me	too	?
Something	big	is	on	for	tonight	,	it	seems	.
We	've	been	called	in	,	as	have	Divisions	5	and	9	...	as	well	as	Section	2-	B.
Good	Lord	.
It	's	no	use	,	Kent	.
The	doctor	is	more	powerful	than	you	.
Is	your	curiosity	satisfied	now	,
Inspector	?
--------------------
And	this	corpse	is	clearly	identified	as	Mabuse	?
There	's	no	doubt	of	that	?
Unfortunately	not	,	Inspector	.
Unfortunately	it	is	only	too	certain	that	this	dead	man	here	is	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Or	was	.
Alas	.
This	assessment	of	the	deceased
Is	smoking	permitted	here	?
Yes	.
seems	to	me	to	be	slightly	,	let	's	say
--------------------
Do	you	smoke	?
No	,	thanks	.
let	's	say	slightly	exaggerated	.
In	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	,	we	're	not	dealing	with	a	human	being	of	value	but	with	an	evil	criminal	who	only	escaped	the	gallows	by	entering	an	insane	asylum	.
One	less	insane	criminal	in	the	world	.
Silence	!
You	have	no	idea	.
No	one	has	any	idea	what	kind	of	phenomenal	,	superhuman	mind	has	come	to	an	end	with	Dr.	Mabuse	's	death	.
This	mind	would	have	laid	waste	to	our	whole	rotten	world	,	which	is	long	overdue	for	destruction	.
This	godless	world	,	devoid	of	justice	and	compassion	,	consisting	only	of	selfishness	,	cruelty	and	hatred	.
--------------------
This	mind	would	have	destroyed	mankind	,	which	itself	knows	only	destruction	and	extermination	and	which	could	only	have	been	saved	in	its	final	hour	through	terror	and	horror	.
Mabuse	the	criminal	?
Mabuse	the	genius	!
His	intellectual	legacy	would	have	turned	your	world	,	with	its	police	protection	,	on	its	head	!
His	legacy	?
You	speak	of	Mabuse	's	legacy	?
No	.
Yes	.
Of	course	,	not	a	testament	in	the	accepted	sense	of	the	word	.
Just	some	of	his	notes	,	of	interest	only	to	physicians	and	men	of	science	.
--------------------
I	'm	afraid	,	Professor	,	that	you	underestimate	the	number	of	subjects	in	which	I	take	an	interest	.
Take	,	for	example	,	a	case	which	concerns	me	intimately	.
Wasn	't	a	young	man	admitted	to	your	institution	earlier	today	by	the	name	of	Hofmeister	?
May	I	see	that	man	?
I	'm	terribly	sorry	,	Inspector	.
That	man	seems	to	be	suffering	the	effects	of	some	frightful	experience	that	he	relives	each	time	someone	approaches	him	.
Then	he	begins	singing	like	a	frightened	child	sings	in	the	dark	.
I	must	therefore	request	,	for	the	good	of	the	patient	,	that	you	refrain	from	seeing	him	now	.
What	is	it	?
Forgive	me	,	Professor	.
--------------------
We	only	wanted	to
They	're	waiting	for	you	in	anatomy	class	.
Yes	,	of	course	.
Well	,	I	see	the	doctor	's	cell	is	already	occupied	again	.
Yes	,	the	new	one	who	arrived	last	night	.
The	professor	ordered	that	he	be	isolated	.
The	doctor	's	cell	just	became	vacant	,	so	we	put	him	in	it	.
It	's	strange	when	you	come	to	think	of	it	.
For	10	years	I	've	cared	for	the	doctor	,	and	now	he	lies	down	there	in	the	morgue	.
Or	what	's	left	of	him	.

Good	evening	,	Tom	.
I	was	here	in	the	afternoon	,	too	,	but	you	weren	't	home	.
Nor	were	you	here	earlier	this	evening	.
So	I	waited	,	Tom	,	a	terribly	long	time	.
Won	't	you	at	least	offer	me	a	seat	in	return	,	Tom	?
What	a	lovely	place	you	have	here	.
I	like	rooms	that	have	such	wide	,	tall	windows	.
Lovely	.
--------------------
Is	this	true	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
But	I	wrote	to	you	!
And	I	gave	you	my	answer	,	Tom	.
But	you	don	't	even	know	who	I	am	,	Lilli	.
My	dear	Tom	,	isn	't	that	entirely	beside	the	point	?
Beside	the	point	?
Entirely	beside	the	point	!
We	'll	see	right	now	whether	it	's	beside	the	point	!
There	you	have	it	,	in	black	and	white	-	just	who	I	am	.

The	last	six	months	commuted	for	good	behavior	.
There	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
You	don	't	know	why	I	was	in	prison	.
I	killed	two	people	.
--------------------
One	was	my	girlfriend	,	and	the	other	was	the	man	I	'd	thought	was	my	best	friend	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
Then	I	'm	forced	to	tell	you	the	rest	,	Lilli	.
I	...
I	lied	to	you	,	Lilli	!
I	told	you	I	'd	found	a	position	,	didn	't	I	?
Well	,	I	certainly	did	.
Do	you	know	where	?
In	a	counterfeiting	lab	.
--------------------
That	's	one	place	that	can	use	an	engineer	who	's	an	ex-	con	.
If	I	had	only	known	what	I	know	now	.
You	see	,	Lilli	?
This	time	you	don	't	say	,
"	Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.	"
Look	,	Tom	.
When	I	received	your	letter	,	did	you	really	think	me	so	dense	that	I	wouldn	't	sense	the	despair	in	your	heart	?
I	thought	to	myself	,
"	What	he	needs	is	to	regain	his	faith	in	himself	,	to	believe	that	everything	can	turn	out	well	again	.	"
--------------------
And	I	thought	to	myself	,
"	Maybe	you	can	restore	his	faith	in	himself	if	you	tell	him	how	much	you	care	for	him	and	that	you	will	stand	by	him	for	better	or	for	worse	.	"
And	so	I	came	to	you	.
Tell	me	,	have	you	taken	it	upon	yourself	to	rob	me	of	my	last	shred	of	sanity	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
You	!
You	!
You	have	to	report	that	he	's	failed	to	show	up	.
Let	's	wait	.
Finished	.
--------------------
I	guess	I	have	no	other	choice	.
Section	2-	B	?
Yes	.
This	is	Division	3	.
I	must	report	that	Kent	didn	't	show	up	.
Believe	me	,	Tom	,	your	life	is	just	beginning	.
A	brand-	new	life	,	clean	,	spotless	and	good	.
It	's	true	,	Tom	!
We	'll	put	it	all	behind	us	and	make	a	fresh	start	.
And	you	know	who	'll	help	us	?
--------------------
Help	us	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
The	man	who	once
When	he	had	to	arrest	you	,	he	was	so	decent	and	compassionate	towards	you	.
Lohmann	?
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Voberg	is	here	.
He	claims	to	have	some	important	news	.
Give	me	a	cigar	and	raise	the	shades	.
--------------------
Then	show	him	in	.
Morning	,	Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Well	,	Inspector	,	it	's	like	this	.
Scholz	and	I	think	we	've	stumbled	across	something
Lower	those	shades	.
Clumsy	fool	.
We	stumbled	across	something	that	might	lead	us	to	the	jewelry	robbers	.
Is	that	so	?
We	saw	a	girl	running	around	with	a	big	pearl	necklace	.
--------------------
She	could	tell	me	anything	at	all	,	that	she	bought	the	thing	at	Woolworth	's	for	25	pfennigs	.
But	Scholz	knows	about	these	things	,	and	he	swears	that	necklace	is	genuine	.
Well	,	is	it	?
So	far	all	we	know	is	that	she	's	the	sweetheart	of	a	scoundrel	who	's	an	expert	on	anything	having	to	do	with	jewelry	robberies	.
Where	are	the	others	?
They	had	a	few	details	to	take	care	of	.
Come	along	,	quietly	.
Come	along	,	Kent	.
Come	on	,	let	's	go	!
Off	you	go	,	then	,	but	remember	:
--------------------
Be	careful	.
You	're	dealing	with	a	dangerous	international	crook	.
Understand	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
All	right	then	.
Good	luck	.
Good	day	,	Chief	.
Let	the	woman	go	free	.
Do	with	me	what	you	like	,	but	let	her	go	free	.
You	monster	!
--------------------
Tom	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Stay	back	!
Good	God	!
What	's	that	?
Tom	,	what	's	that	?
What	's	that	,	Tom	?
Whatever	it	is	,	Lilli	,	we	must	find	it	and	put	an	end	to	it	.
He	won	't	be	able	to	do	it	anymore	.
What	do	you	mean	?
He	's	otherwise	engaged	.
--------------------
Who	could	that	be	?
How	do	I	know	?
Maybe	it	's	the	mailman	.
Anni	!
Wanna	go	and	see	who	that	is	?
Hold	on	.
Who	is	it	?
The	gas	man	.
I	'd	like	to	inspect	the	meter	.
Afternoon	,	miss	.
--------------------
You	want	to	look	at	the	meter	?
Come	back	some	other	time	.
I	've	got	company	right	now	.
How	dare	you	!
Police	.
Open	up	.
Look	out	!
Police	!
Don	't	shoot	!
Shut	up	,	you	idiot	!
--------------------
Get	out	!
Quick	,	out	the	back	door	!
We	don	't	have	one	!
You	idiots	get	an	apartment	with	only	one	exit	?
What	about	the	window	?
From	the	fourth	floor	?
There	must	be	some	way	out	!
Shall	I	put	in	an	elevator	for	you	guys	?
Now	we	're	really	done	for	!
That	guy	will	call	all	his	cop	friends	.
--------------------
And	on	a	Sunday	,	too	.
What	're	you	crying	about	?
It	's	your	own	damn	fault	for	firing	at	him	!
Leave	me	alone	,	you	hear	?
Stop	giving	me	a	hard	time	!
Listen	,	try	to	knock	a	hole	through	the	ceiling	.
Maybe	we	can	escape	to	the	roof	.
I	'll	try	to	hit	the	guy	and	keep	him	back	from	the	door	!
Stay	back	.
Notify	the	Special	Tactics	Squad	and	get	hold	of
--------------------
Damned	scoundrel	!
Who	should	I	get	hold	of	?
Homicide	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	'll	never	get	out	this	way	.
The	window	,	Tom	.
We	could	try	to	break	through	that	.
Cement	.
But	the	brick	,	maybe	.
--------------------
Damn	it	!
Hey	!
How	far	are	you	in	there	?
I	can	't	hold	this	door	forever	.
Lohmann	and	his	whole	gang	are	here	.
Lohmann	?
That	's	it	!
I	'm	out	!
Get	yourself	killed	,	all	of	you	!
What	do	you	mean	by	that	?
--------------------
What	do	I	mean	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	I	mean	!
Watch	the	door	!
Out	of	the	way	.
Hardy	,	be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	won	't	get	anywhere	on	the	roof	.
Let	me	talk	to	them	.
Let	me	tell	you	something	.
Anyone	who	gets	near	that	door	,	inside	or	out	,	is	gonna	get	it	,	understand	?
--------------------
Go	keep	an	eye	on	them	!
Move	it	!
Almost	.
Now	.
Let	's	see	now	.
What	's	the	matter	,	Tom	?
It	's	no	use	,	Lilli	.
Behind	those	bricks	is	a	steel	plate	.
Dear	God	!
Careful	!
--------------------
A	bullet	can	cripple	you	for	life	!
Is	he	dead	?
Karetzky	.
Goddamn	this	mess	!
Anni	,	get	some	towels	.
Come	on	,	quick	!
It	's	no	use	.
Better	keep	an	eye	on	the	door	.
Why	didn	't	you	let	me	negotiate	?
You	and	your	stupid	shooting	!
--------------------
Bredow	,	shoot	anyone	who	comes	near	the	door	!
Do	you	hear	?
You	bet	I	will	!
I	've	had	enough	of	this	business	.
I	've	got	you	now	.
Open	up	!
It	's	Lohmann	!
What	's	the	matter	?
Lohmann	's	outside	.
I	forbid	you	to	go	!
--------------------
Who	are	you	to	forbid	anything	?
I	won	't	land	in	jail	'cause	of	you	!
Think	I	'll	let	you	cowardly	swine	send	me	to	the	slaughter	?
Be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	've	got	hand	grenades	.
I	'll	give	you	one	last	chance	.
If	you	're	reasonable	,	we	'll	be	reasonable	too	.
That	's	the	way	.
Attaboy	.
--------------------
Daddy	's	proud	of	you	.
Now	,	open	the	door	and	put	your	hands	up	.
How	many	of	you	are	there	?
Five	,	Inspector	.
One	,	two	,	three	.
Diamond	Anna	!
See	you	don	't	catch	a	cold	,	my	dear	.
Four	.
Where	's	the	fifth	?
Damn	it	!
--------------------
Don	't	try	anything	!
A	Dreyse	pistol	.
What	do	you	know	?
A	Dreyse	pistol	,	no	less	.
Made	in	1906	,	7	.	65-	mm	.
Apparently	the	former	owner	-	a	friend	of	yours
No	.
No	?
That	's	funny	.
It	says	here	that	the	two	of	you	were	close	friends	.
--------------------
It	's	signed	by	Karetzky	,	Diamond	Anna	,	and	her	sweetheart	.
One	shouldn	't	forsake	a	friend	who	's	died	.
I	'm	not	forsaking	him	.
That	's	more	like	it	.
So	your	old	buddy	held	on	to	this	gun	because	he	was	used	to	it	.
Actually	,	haven	't	these	things	been	out	of	style	for	a	long	time	?
I	'm	no	gun	expert	.
That	's	right	.
You	're	more	of	an	expert	on	automobiles	.
What	make	of	car	did	Dr.	Kramm	drive	?
--------------------
A	"	Hanomag	"	or	a	DKW	?
Who	?
Dr.	Kramm	,	the	guy	you	two	rubbed	out	from	your	car	.
I	don	't	know	what	you	're	talking	about	,	Inspector	.
Is	that	so	?
Müiler	.
It	's	no	good	,	Lilli	.
I	can	't	find	a	thing	.
God	almighty	.
There	,	there	.
--------------------
Steady	,	Lilli	.
My	dear	little	Lilli	.
There	might	be	another	way	.
It	's	a	long	shot	.
What	if	we	flood	the	room	with	water	?
Water	?
Yes	.
Where	did	I
What	are	you	looking	for	,	Tom	?
My	knife	.
--------------------
Water	lessens	the	force	of	an	explosion	.
There	it	is	.
Out	of	the	way	.
It	just	might	break	through	the	wall	for	us	.
What	if	it	doesn	't	,	Tom	?
If	the	water	rises	,	and	we	're
Let	's	try	it	,	Tom	.
Here	you	are	,	Inspector	.
Thank	you	.
So	you	don	't	know	anything	about	Dr.	Kramm	's	murder	?
--------------------
No	,	Inspector	.
The	first	I	heard	of	it	was	right	here	.
Let	me	show	you	something	.
Come	here	.
Come	,	come	.
Take	a	look	at	this	still	life	.
You	're	familiar	with	this	here	.
A	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	made	in	1906	.
It	belonged	to	your	friend	.
He	shot	himself	with	it	,	didn	't	he	?
--------------------
Yes	.
Fine	.
But	do	you	know	what	's	in	there	?
No	.
Well	,	then	,	look	here	.
Take	that	magnifying	glass	and	take	a	careful	look	at	these	two	Easter	eggs	.
Well	?
See	any	difference	?
No	,	not	the	slightest	.
You	see	,	my	boy	,	that	's	just	it	!
--------------------
None	of	us	police	could	detect	any	difference	either	,	neither	with	the	magnifying	glass	nor	in	the	photographs	.
These	two	bullets	are	so	completely	identical	that	they	could	only	have	been	fired	from	the	same	gun	.
Yet	one	was	taken	from	the	skull	of	the	deceased	Dr.	Kramm	,	and	the	other	was	found	in	the	skull	of	your	dead	friend	Hardy	.
Glass	of	water	,	my	lad	?
Cigarette	.
So	now	tell	me	why	your	friend	Hardy	shot	and	killed	Dr.	Kramm	.
I	can	't	tell	you	that	,	Inspector	.
Liar	!
Kill	me	if	you	like	,	but	I	don	't	know	what	Hardy	's	orders	were	!
So	you	had	orders	?
--------------------
Not	me	.
Hardy	.
From	whom	?
I	couldn	't	tell	you	,	Inspector	.
I	've	never	seen	the	man	in	my	life	.
Now	enters	the	mystery	man	.
Come	on	in	and	pull	up	a	chair	.
Just	what	we	needed	:	the	man	in	the	shadows	.
So	you	don	't	know	the	man	's	name	?
On	my	honor	,	Inspector	,	I	don	't	know	who	gave	Hardy	those	orders	.
--------------------
Then	there	's	nothing	we	can	do	.
Dictate	for	the	record	what	you	know	about	the	whole	case	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Müiler	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
It	was	like	this	,	Mr.	Assistant	Inspector	.
I	was	just
I	was	just	washing	my	car	,	because	everything	has	to	be	in	top	shape	in	these	days	of	keen	competition	.
Suddenly	the	phone	rings	,	and	Hardy	picks	it	up	.
Then	he	came	and	said	we	were	to	catch	up	with	Dr.	Kramm	's	car	at	the	intersection	of	Körnerstrasse	and	Grüner	Winkel	.
--------------------
So	we	set	out	,	of	course	,	and	pretty	soon	he	showed	up	.
Sergeant	,	take	this	man	away	.
Isn	't	Professor	Baum	's	insane	asylum	on	Grüner	Winkel	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
So	that	's	where	Dr.	Kramm	spent	his	final	two	hours	.
Look	and	see	if	we	have	any	police	record	for	Dr.	Baum	.
Baum	-	Bertha	,	Anna	,	Ulrich	,	Max	.
Nothing	on	him	?
Well	,	that	was	-	Thank	you	.
Get	Professor	Baum	on	the	phone	for	me	.
--------------------
Professor	,	it	's	police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	wishes	to	speak	to	you	.
This	is	Professor	Baum	.
This	man	swears	you	've	been	treating	him	for	the	last	two	months	.
I	think	he	's	just	trying	to	establish	an	alibi	.
I	'd	like	to	confront	him	with	you	.
Without	him	knowing	who	you	are	,	of	course	.
Could	you	come	over	right	away	?
Thanks	a	million	,	Professor	.
If	I	'm	on	the	right	track	now	,
--------------------
I	'm	gonna	get	high	as	a	kite	tonight	!
That	's	our	way	out	!
We	're	saved	!
Inspector	,	when	are	you	going	to	let	me	out	of	this	monkey	cage	?
My	dear	fellow	,	we	're	glad	we	've	got	you	in	there	.
But	I	've	told	you	everything	I	know	.
We	'll	see	about	that	.
Professor	,	please	.
Well	,	Professor	,	do	you	know	that	man	?
Is	he	the	one	?
--------------------
No	,	Inspector	.
I	've	definitely	never	seen	him	before	.
Just	as	I	thought	.
You	there	.
Then	I	've	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Professor	.
Sorry	to	disturb	you	,	Inspector	,	but	we	need	your	signature	here	.
I	'll	be	right	with	you	.
Pardon	me	a	moment	,	Professor	.
Perhaps	you	might	wait	in	my	office	.
--------------------
Room	204	,	at	the	end	of	the	hall	.
Thanks	.
Any	of	you	know	that	man	?
No	,	Inspector	.
No	.
Never	seen	him	before	.
Bredow	,	do	you	know	the	man	you	just	saw	with	me	?
No	,	Inspector	.
I	don	't	know	the	gentleman	.
Not	the	slightest	doubt	?
--------------------
No	.
MURDER	-	2,	000	MARKS	REWARD
Sad	business	,	isn	't	it	?
Especially	for	you	,	since	you	were	a	close	friend	of	the	victim	.
Yes	,	we	were	on	excellent	terms	as	colleagues	.
The	poor	fellow	even	visited	you	on	the	day	of	his	death	.
You	could	have	saved	us	a	lot	of	work	,	Professor	,	if	you	'd	reported	that	to	the	police	.
INFORMATlON	OF	ANY	KlND
ESPEClALLY	CONCERNlNG	THE	HOURS	FROM	6	:	00	TO	8	:	00	P.	M.
This	request	was	published	in	every	newspaper	and	posted	on	kiosks	all	over	the	city	.
--------------------
I	never	read	newspapers	,	only	medical	literature	.
And	today	's	the	first	time	I	've	been	in	town	in	four	weeks	.
Dr.	Kramm	came	to	look	something	up	in	a	scientific	book	in	my	library	.
He	left	in	the	best	of	spirits	.
As	for	his	death	,	it	's	as	much	a	mystery	to	me	as	it	is	to	you	.
Then	I	'm	terribly	sorry	to	have	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Why	,	it	's	Kent	!
Do	you	know	him	?
Who	?
Him	.
--------------------
I	asked	you	if	you	knew	him	.
Where	would	I	know	him	from	?
I	have	no	idea	,	yet	you	just	spoke	his	name	.
I	did	?
That	was	you	,	Inspector	.
Inspector	,	I	must	speak	to	you	.
It	's	terribly	urgent	.
I	suppose	I	may	leave	,	Inspector	?
My	time	is
Of	course	.
--------------------
By	all	means	,	Professor	.
Just	a	moment	,	Kent	.
Many	thanks	for	coming	.
Don	't	mention	it	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
Inspector	,	please	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
Go	on	in	.
It	's	all	right	.
It	's	tremendously	important	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
--------------------
This	is	crucial	:
Do	you	know	that	man	who	just	left	?
No	.
Are	you	certain	?
I	'm	certain	.
Yet	I	could	swear	he	knew	you	.
Most	certainly	not	.
I	've	never	seen	him	before	.
Damn	it	!
What	happened	to	you	,	for	God	's	sake	?
--------------------
That	's	why	we	've	come	.
And	what	is	the	name	of	this	"	boss	"	you	mention	?
Dr.	Mabuse	.
Goddamn	it	!
Mabuse	again	!
That	fellow	is	dead	!
He	's	alive	and	kicking	,	I	tell	you	.
I	saw	the	cadaver	myself	.
Bless	you	.
It	's	true	.
--------------------
I	'm	telling	you	,	he	's	not	dead	.
I	think	the	two	of	us	are	living	proof	of	that	,	though	as	for	"	living	,	"	that	was	pure	luck	!
Inspector	,	I	put	myself	completely	in	your	hands	.
Last	night	...
I	could	have	fled	but	I	didn	't	,	because	I	realized	this	is	about	more	than	my	life	or	liberty	.
My	God	,	how	can	I	convince	you	?
Is	this	proof	enough	for	you	?
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
Typewritten	.
That	's	no	proof	.
--------------------
Someone	else	could	have
"	Someone	else	"	?
I	'm	not	in	for	anybody	.
No	exceptions	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
All	the	evidence	leads	again	and	again	to	that	insane	asylum	.
Müiler	,	get	the	car	.
I	may	be	putting	my	neck	on	the	line	,	but	I	'm	going	out	there	once	more	,	and	you	're	going	with	me	,	Kent	.
Perhaps	you	're	right	and
Gentlemen	,	it	's	really	impossible	.
--------------------
The	professor	gave	strict	orders	not	to	disturb	him	.
My	good	man	,	I	must	speak	with	him	.
Now	go	on	and	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector	-	-	Will	you	announce	me	or	not	?
I	have	strict	instructions	-	-	Fine	.
Don	't	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector
That	's	him	!
That	's	his	voice	!
What	?
--------------------
That	's	the	boss	's	voice	.
I	'd	recognize	it	anywhere	.
That	's	the	man	!
Where	is	the	man	whose	voice	we	just	heard	?
Kent	,	come	over	here	.
What	is	it	?
That	's	his	voice	.
Nice	little	contraption	.
Very	clever	.
No	wonder	you	failed	to	recognize	the	man	's	voice	.
--------------------
You	only	heard	a	mechanical	reproduction	of	it	.
The	professor	?
Baum	.
Of	course	.
But	where	is	he	hiding	?
What	's	this	?
A	map	of	the	northern	part	of	town	?
That	must	be	the	Löhr	&	Stegerwald	chemical	factory	.
CHEMlCAL	PLANT	-	OCTOBER	15TH
And	today	's	date	.
--------------------
Strange	.
Very	strange	.
What	's	one	to	make	of	that	?
There	's	something	else	here	.
It	's	in	pencil	.
8	:	30	p	.	m	.	,	and	today	's	date	.
It	's	now	9	:	10	.
Kent	,	call	the	chemical	plant	.
There	won	't	be	anyone	there	,	but	they	must	have	guards	.
And	here	's	something	else	.
--------------------
"	Notes	by	Dr.	Mabuse	"	?
Isn	't	that	interesting	.
Go	ahead	.
Good	Lord	!
The	chemical	factory	!
"	Fires	started	in	this	manner	in	a	chemical	factory	's	storerooms	cannot	be	extinguished	by	firefighters	.
Tanks	exploding	from	the	heat	will	quickly	release	immense	quantities	of	poisonous	gas	into	surrounding	areas	of	the	city	.	"
Damn	it	!
They	're	playing	cards	again	instead	of	keeping	guard	.
Here	's	your	line	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
Police	headquarters	?
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Lohmann	,	look	!
What	?
In	the	light	there	!
Quiet	.
Over	there	!
Nothing	.
Damn	it	!
There	.
--------------------
Krause	!
Where	's	my	driver	?
Krause	!
Where	is	that	guy	?
Krause	!
I	'll	drive	,	Inspector	.
Push	that	car	out	of	the	way	.
I	just	hope	this	piece	of	junk	can	make	it	.
Faster	,	faster	!
Come	on	!
--------------------
CAUTlON	-	RAlLROAD	CROSSlNG
Get	out	of	the	way	!
Faster	!
Come	on	!
Now	we	're	done	for	.
Get	the	spare	.
Permit	me	to	introduce	myself	.
My	name	is	Mabuse	.
Dr.	Mabuse	.
For	heaven	's	sake	!
--------------------
Who	opened	that	door	?
Run	and	get	help	!
He	'll	kill	him	!
Police	.
We	're	looking	for
Hofmeister	!
Inspector	!
That	man	's	name	is	Mabuse	.
Come	,	my	boy	.
There	's	nothing	left	to	do	here	for	a	mere	police	inspector	.

You	know	that	one	,	Müiler	?
That	's	from	Die	Walküre	.
Those	are	the	girls	who	carry	dead	police	inspectors	directly	up	to	heaven	from	the	Alexanderplatz	with	a	"	Hey	ho	.	"
On	horseback	.
Horseback	?
Certainly	.
Expenses	don	't	allow	for	a	car	.
--------------------
Well	,	Inspector	,	when	it	comes	to	corpses	,	the	state	sometimes	has	...	a	fit	of	generosity	.
That	's	what	you	think	.
Believe	it	or	not	,	Müiler	,	tonight	will	be	the	first	time
I	make	it	to	the	theater	in	time	for	the	first	act	.
Knock	on	wood	,	Inspector	.
There	.
What	did	I	tell	you	?
Tell	'em	I	'm	dead	.
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
--------------------
Inspector	.
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Hofmeister	would	like	to	speak	with	you	,	Inspector	.
What	?
Our	former	colleague	who	got	into	trouble	with	foreign	currency	?
That	scoundrel	?
Tell	him	his	call	is	the	most	shameless	affront
I	've	ever	experienced	!
And	tell	him	to	go	to	hell	!
--------------------
I	'm	sorry	,	but	Inspector	Lohmann	has	already	left	and	he	says	you
And	he	says	you	can	go	to	hell	!
God	help	me	!
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	Müiler	.
I	once	had	high	hopes	for	that	fellow	Hofmeister	.
I	gave	him	his	first	chance	.
And	what	does	the	scoundrel	do	?
He	takes	a	bribe	from	a	black-	market	currency	trader	.
Phooey	!
The	man	I	would	have	staked	my	life	for	disgraces	me	by	getting	fired	from	the	service
--------------------
like	a	bad	egg	.
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
He	has	to	hear	me	out	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Tell	him	it	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	,	I	think	you	really	ought	to
Of	course	I	'll	miss	the	first	act	again	!
I	want	to	redeem	myself	in	his	eyes	!
I	finally	figured	out	their	scheme	.
It	's	a	monstrous	business	!
--------------------
They	've	nearly	done	me	in	three	times	!
I	hardly	dare	cross	the	street	!
Lohmann	speaking	.
What	is	it	?
Inspector	?
Thank	you	.
Cut	out	the	nonsense	and	tell	me	what	's	wrong	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
I	've	finally	discovered
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
--------------------
Just	in	case	,	Inspector	,	please	have	a	record	made	of	my	report	.
Headphones	.
Take	this	down	.
I	was	actually	tracing	counterfeit	money	.
I	wanted	to	redeem	myself	in	your	eyes	,	Inspector	.
For	four	days	-	96	hours
I	lay	up	there	at	the	air	vent	,	and	now	I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	.
But	you	'll	probably	think	I	'm	crazy	.
Who	is	it	?
I	swear	I	'm	telling	the	truth	.
--------------------
I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	!
I	heard	his	name	with	my	own	ears	!
And	now	they	know	I	know	the	name	.
My	God	!
The	lights	have	gone	out	!
Lohmann	,	help	me	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Can	you	trace	that	call	?
For	God	's	sake	!
Hofmeister	!
What	street	?
--------------------
Number	23	?
Thanks	.
Gloria
Lovely	are	the	maidens	in	Batavia
Dear	God	.
He	must	have	gone	out	of	his	mind	from	terror	.
A	pathological	condition	that	is	not	as	rare	as	one	might	suspect	.
Exposure	to	catastrophes	such	as	explosions	,	earthquakes	and	railway	accidents	-	in	short	,	exposure	to	fright	and	horror	often	triggers	insanity	.
Perhaps	the	most	interesting	case	of	such	pathological	conditions	is	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Here	he	goes	again	.
--------------------
I	shall	briefly	recount	the	history	of	this	case	.
The	patient	lived	a	decidedly	double	life	.
He	was	a	renowned	doctor	with	a	large	private	practice	.
Aided	by	an	almost	superhuman	logic	,	he	used	his	profound	knowledge	of	hypnosis	to	commit	crimes	of	a	magnitude	previously	deemed	impossible	.
For	months	the	police	sought	the	mastermind	behind	those	crimes	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	.
At	last	they	discovered	his	whereabouts	.
But	Mabuse	decided	not	to	flee	but	rather	to	mount	armed	resistance	,	and	he	barricaded	himself	in	his	house	with	four	loyal	henchmen	.
He	refused	demands	to	surrender	to	state	authorities	,	saying	,
"	I	am	the	state	!	"
A	barrage	of	bullets	forced	the	police	to	retreat	.
--------------------
Finally	,	soldiers	stormed	the	house	with	hand	grenades	.
Two	of	the	defenders	were	killed	.
Two	were	captured	.
Mabuse	,	however	,	had	disappeared	.
One	prisoner	revealed	his	hiding	place	:	a	counterfeiting	lab	from	which	he	planned	to	launch	a	massive	attack	on	the	German	currency	system	.
The	police	force	their	way	in	to	seize	him	only	to	find	he	had	gone	hopelessly	insane	.
Judging	by	his	incoherent	remarks	,	he	had	seen	,	during	the	previous	night	,	the	ghosts	of	all	those	he	had	slain	.
Apparently	it	was	the	horror	of	that	experience	that	overpowered	this	phenomenal	mind	,	which	for	so	long	had	straddled	the	fine	line	between	genius	and	madness	,	and	literally	deranged	it	.
Mabuse	was	committed	to	an	insane	asylum	and	to	this	day	has	not	spoken	a	word	to	anyone	.
Silent	and	motionless	,	he	remains	in	the	position	you	see	here	.
--------------------
The	patient	withdrew	into	his	own	ego	,	depriving	us	of	any	glimpse	into	his	inner	life	.
But	suddenly	the	clinical	profile	changed	.
We	observed	that	Mabuse	's	hand	continuously	made	writing	motions	in	the	air	,	on	the	wall	and	on	the	bedspread	.
We	gave	him	pencil	and	paper	.
At	first	,	he	covered	the	paper	with	senseless	scribbling	.
Two	years	ago	,	however	,	certain	words	began	to	appear	on	the	paper	.
Then	,	sentences	began	to	form	,	still	meaningless	and	confused	.
Gradually	they	grew	more	coherent	and	logical	,	and	at	last	we	began	to	get	glimpses	into	the	extraordinary	phenomenon	that	was	his	mind	.
His	thoughts	still	move	in	the	same	criminal	channels	as	before	.
Whatever	Mabuse	writes	is	based	upon	incontrovertible	logic	and	serves	as	a	perfect	guide	for	the	commission	of	crimes	worked	out	to	the	minutest	detail	.
--------------------
No	.
Nothing	can	happen	to	us	if	we	follow	the	doctor	's	methods	.
Oh	,	yeah	?
What	do	you	mean	,	"	oh	,	yeah	"	?
The	first	attacks	on	the	snitch	failed	.
So	what	?
Tough	luck	.
So	we	called	in	Division	2-	B	to	handle	the	matter	.
If	they	succeed	,	fine	.
And	if	they	don	't	-	if	it	looks	like	that	snitch	might	rat	on	us	-	one	single	phone	call	and	this	whole	place	gets	blown	sky-	high	.
--------------------
Stop	scratching	,	Fritzi	.
It	won	't	come	to	that	.
Before	that	guy	can	open	his	mouth	,	he	'll	be	done	for	.
I	'd	feel	better	if	they	didn	't	resort	to	murder	.
What	do	you	mean	,	murder	?
A	guy	can	have	something	fall	on	his	head	,	can	't	he	?
A	nice	,	clean	little	accident	.
I	don	't	care	how	you	make	it	look	.
I	just	don	't	want	anything	to	do	with	murder	.
Scared	?
--------------------
Can	't	bear	the	sight	of	blood	?
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	though	it	's	really	none	of	your	damn	business	.
I	've	killed	two	people	.
I	know	what	it	means	to	kill	.
And	that	's	precisely	why
I	want	nothing	to	do	with	murder	.
Leave	him	alone	,	Fritzi	.
What	do	you	know	about	Kent	?
The	phone	!
Yeah	?
--------------------
It	's	been	taken	care	of	?
Bravo	!
Really	?
Just	20	minutes	later	?
Lohmann	himself	?
Continue	writing	.
Hofmeister	himself	has	disappeared	.
The	rug	has	been	moved	toward	the	window	.
He	was	on	the	phone	when	the	lights	went	out	.
Where	's	the	light	switch	?
--------------------
Here	by	the	door	.
So	it	came	from	over	there	,	the	unknown	horror	,	the	thing	that	caused	his	mind	to	snap	.
And	he	backed	away	from	it	step	by	step	,	right	up	to	the	window	.
I	wonder	if	he
No	,	he	couldn	't	get	out	this	way	.
Certainly	not	downward	.
Well	,	I	'll	be	damned	!
Actual	letters	scratched	into	the	glass	with	a	ring	.
So	he	was	trying	to	tell	me	something	.
Is	that	a	W	?
--------------------
No	.
Could	it	be	a	name	?
It	may	take	us	a	while	to	figure	that	one	out	.
Hey	,	Krüger	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Take	this	pane	of	glass	to	my	office	at	headquarters	.
And	see	that	you	don	't	break	it	,	or	I	'll	bite	your	head	off	.
That	's	odd	.
I	wonder	what	's	behind	that	.
Thirty	pages	today	,	Professor	.
--------------------
Thank	you	.
Keep	a	careful	eye	on	him	tonight	.
I	don	't	like	his	pulse	.
In	any	case	,	give	him	a	shot	later	so	he	can	get	some	rest	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
Their	famous	chocolate	shake	?
And	a	double	mocha	for	you	,	sir	?
With	hot	cream	.
As	usual	.
Very	well	.
--------------------
And	now	tell	me	,	Tom	.
Why	did	you	ask	to	see	me	so	urgently	today	?
Don	't	you	know	what	today	is	,	Lilli	?
Today	?
Too	bad	.
Won	't	you	tell	me	?
Certainly	.
A	chocolate	shake	and	a	double	mocha	with	hot	cream	.
Well	,	Tom	?
You	ask	what	day	this	is	?
--------------------
Exactly	one	year	ago	today	,	at	the	employment	office
No	smoking	,	gentlemen	.
Smoking	is	prohibited	.
Good	heavens	,	my	friend	,	are	you	back	again	?
I	've	told	you	a	hundred	times	there	's	no	point	in	coming	every	day	.
When	we	have	work	for	you	,	we	'll	certainly	notify	you	.
I	've	been	waiting	for	three	months	!
Be	reasonable	.
Reasonable	?
What	does	reasonable	mean	when	a	man	is	going	under	?
--------------------
I	want	to	work	!
But	they	keep	pushing	me	closer	to	the	edge	!
It	's	enough	to	drive	a	man	to	crime	!
He	's	forced	to	become	a	criminal	!
He	marches	in	here	and	causes	a	riot	!
Don	't	get	so	worked	up	.
We	have	others	to	attend	to	.
Come	now	.
Leave	him	alone	.
He	's	sick	.
--------------------
Come	now	.
Don	't	touch	me	!
I	'll	go	on	my	own	!
You	'll	never	see	me	again	here	!
Next	,	please	.
You	've	seen	the	last	of	me	!
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
I	can	't	bear	to	see	you	leave	like	this	.
Here	are	20	marks	.
It	's	all	I	have	right	now	,	but	I	'd	like	you	to	have	it	.
--------------------
It	may	help	you	out	.
I	don	't	want	charity	.
I	want	work	,	not	a	handout	.
It	's	not	a	handout	.
It	's	just	a	loan	.
I	'm	sure	you	'll	be	able	to	pay	me	back	.
Please	.
Yes	.
And	six	months	later	,	you	found	work	and	promptly	paid	back	my	20	marks	.
Tell	me	,	Lilli	...
--------------------
have	you	ever	been	in	love	?
It	's	high	time	I	was	going	.
Here	comes	my	bus	.
Please	stay	.
I	can	't	.
I	've	got	to	run	.
Good-	bye	,	Tom	.
Call	me	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
--------------------
If	you	'll	be	seated	,	Doctor	,	the	professor	is	due	back	any	moment	.
Thanks	,	Winkler	.
I	'm	sure	I	'll	find	what	I	need	.
Ah	,	I	see	it	's	on	his	desk	.
Oops	.
Oh	,	dear	!
What	order	does	all	this	go	in	?
This	junk	isn	't	even	numbered	.
What	is	this	anyway	?
NOTES	BY	DR.	MABUSE	SEPTEMBER	1	ST	-	OCTOBER	31	ST
--------------------
How	does	this	go	together	now	?
No	,	the	other	way	around	.
Then	this	page	.
What	's	the	next	part	?
"	Jewel	-	"
No	.
"	Jewel	-	-	ry	store	.	"
"	Jewelry	store	...
specializing	in	high-	quality	...	"
What	?
--------------------
"	The	least	conspicuous	and	therefore	most	effective	precaution	to	prevent	interruption	by	police	,	pedestrians	and	clients	is	to	pull	the	shades	and	hang	a	sign	on	the	door	:
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
Well	,	I	'll	be	!
"	The	criminals	then	lowered	the	shades	and	hung	a	sign	outside	the	door	,
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
If	that	isn	't	something	!
That	's	incredible	!
"	lmmobilize	the	staff	by	using	gas	in	bulbs	of	thin	glass	,	which	will	burst	almost	inaudibly	when	tossed	.	"
Gas	!
Amazing	!
--------------------
Identical	,	almost	to	the	word	!
"	The	criminals	appear	to	have	tossed	bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
"	Bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
If	that	isn	't	odd	!
It	's	as	if	they	were	following	a	blueprint	!
What	are	you	doing	there	?
Baum	.
This	is	the	most	incredible	thing	you	could	imagine	.
Look	here	.
What	is	this	?
--------------------
Where	did	you	get	these	papers	?
Never	mind	that	!
You	know	what	they	are	?
Yes	,	of	course	.
Now	read	this	.
"	Ingenious	jewelry	heist	...	"
That	's	right	.
Read	it	.
"	Jewelry	stolen	valued	at	250,	000	marks	.
Gas	was	used	on	the	employees	.	"
--------------------
Yes	,	just	as	if	they	were	following	your	Dr.	Mabuse	's	instructions	.
A	curious	coincidence	.
Now	wait	just	a	minute	.
You	call	that	a	coincidence	?
What	else	?
Baum	,	old	man	,	coincidences	like	that	just	don	't	happen	.
There	's	some	connection	in	all	this	or	I	'll	eat	my	hat	.
Say	,	I	've	got	a	crazy	idea	.
Could	this	Mabuse	fellow	be	faking	it	?
Maybe	the	guy	isn	't	insane	after	all	.
--------------------
Tell	me	,	do	you	think	that	,	after	treating	a	patient	for	years	,
I	can	't	judge	whether	he	's	really	sick	or	just	pretending	?
I	didn	't	mean	it	like	that	.
But	there	must	be	something	behind	all	this	.
You	know	what	a	genius	this	fellow	was	.
It	's	just	possible	that	his	dead	brain	has	come	back	to	life	.
Couldn	't	Mabuse	be	writing	these	things	as	a	sort	of	blueprint	for	a	gang	of	accomplices	?
You	've	always	had	a	wild	imagination	.
Just	hear	me	out	.
What	if	Mabuse	,	with	his	incredible	hypnotic	powers	,	engaged	in	some	kind	of	telepathic	hypnosis	from	his	cell	?
--------------------
Nonsense	!
Nonsense	?
Say	what	you	like	,	but	there	's	something	weird	going	on	!
Who	else	besides	you	knows	about	Mabuse	's	notes	?
You	sound	just	like	a	policeman	.
I	think	the	police	should	be	informed	of	this	strange	coincidence	.
The	police	?
Of	course	!
Well	,	perhaps
Of	course	you	're	right	.
--------------------
The	police	would	want	to	know	of	this	.
Of	course	!
I	'll	go	to	them	at	once	.
If	I	can	,	I	'll	call	you	from	the	station	.
Good-	bye	.
Please	drive	carefully	,	Doctor	.
It	's	been	raining	.
Thank	you	,	Winkler	.
Good-	bye	.
I	do	not	wish	to	be	disturbed	.

INGENlOUS	JEWELRY	HElST
STOLEN	JEWELRY	VALUED	AT	250,	000	MARKS
Almost	a	quarter	million	in	jewels	.
Pearls	,	platinum	,	gold	.
One	can	do	a	lot	with	that	.
Can	?
Could	!
But	what	will	be	done	with	it	?
What	's	gonna	happen	with	that	quarter	million	?
--------------------
Careful	.
I	ask	you
Will	you	stay	down	?
What	becomes	of	it	,	I	ask	you	?
We	buy	cocaine	with	it	,	morphine	,	heroin	,	opium	,	whatever	you	call	all	that	crap	.
And	instead	of	making	a	killing	off	the	dope	and	fleecing	the	types	who	are	crazy	for	the	stuff	,	they	practically	give	it	away	.
What	good	does	it	do	the	boss	to	pump	the	world	full	of	dope	and	not	make	any	money	off	it	?
These	things	won	't	stay	down	.
What	does	it	get	him	?
I	follow	his	instructions	and	drive	ten	people	nearly	crazy	with	threats	and	blackmail	.
--------------------
And	when	they	're	ready	to	pay	any	sum	we	ask	,	then	I	'm	told	to	back	off	and	forget	about	the	money	.
Only	result	is	they	're	driven	crazy	from	fear	of	a	scandal	.
Is	that	any	business	of	yours	,	old	boy	?
Did	you	ever	fail	to	get	your	pay	on	time	?
That	's	not	what	I	'm	saying	.
Okay	,	then	.
You	handle	the	blackmail	,	and	I	see	to	your	alibi	.
We	get	our	paychecks	like	clockwork	,	so	what	are	you	growling	about	?
I	'm	not	growling	.
I	just	don	't	get	it	.
--------------------
If	a	woman	throws	herself	out	the	window	,	or	a	fellow	blows	his	brains	out	,	like	that	bank	director	,	blackmail	letters	aren	't	of	much	use	.
150	grand	tossed	in	the	gutter	.
Is	there	any	sense	in	that	?
Or	take	the	new	instructions	about	the	explosives	,	and	stealing	poison	from	drugstores	-	that	's	scary	business	.
As	it	's	meant	to	be	,	my	dear	fellow	.
But	why	,	in	the	devil	's	name	?
I	think	you	ask	too	many	questions	.
The	boss	doesn	't	like	that	.
What	?
You	know	him	?
--------------------
No	more	than	you	do	,	or	anyone	else	in	our	gang	.
And	I	'm	not	the	least	bit	curious	.
I	learned	my	lesson	from	your	predecessor	.
He	just	had	to	find	out	what	the	man	looked	like	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	,	the	boss	.
So	one	day	,	without	having	been	summoned	,	he	snuck	into	the	famous	room	with	the	curtain	.
And	that	's	where	we	found	him	.
Or	rather	...	what	was	left	of	him	.
Cut	it	out	,	man	.
You	're	spoiling	my	appetite	.
Let	me	give	you	a	tip	.
--------------------
Let	the	boss	worry	about	this	stuff	.
We	're	well	paid	.
In	fact	,	very	well	paid	.
If	something	goes	wrong	,	we	'll	have	cast-	iron	alibis	or	a	top-	notch	lawyer	.
The	boss	thinks	of	everything	and	takes	care	of	everything	and	demands	not	a	penny	for	himself	of	all	the	loot	.
Not	a	penny	.
See	?
That	's	just	it	.
Why	?
Why	doesn	't	he	take	a	single	penny	for	himself	?
--------------------
I	can	't	understand	that	,	and	that	's	what	's	got	me	jumpy	.
Lots	of	others	in	our	gang	probably	feel	the	same	and	would	like	to	be	done	with	the	whole	thing	but	just	don	't	know	how	.
"	Dearest	Lilli	,	you	dashed	off	so	quickly	this	afternoon	that	I	had	no	chance	to	say	what	I	wanted	to	tell	you	.
I	-	"
TONlGHT	AT	1	:	00	A.	M.	-	DR.	MABUSE
You	say	you	searched	the	furthest	precincts	and	found	no	trace	of	Hofmeister	?
His	description	was	sent	to	all	officers	?
Inspector	Lohmann	asks	if	you	had	the	hospitals	searched	.
A	special	squad	did	that	,	and	Hofmeister	hasn	't	been	admitted	anywhere	?
Damn	it	!
--------------------
You	'll	call	back	?
Wait	a	minute	.
Get	a	picture	of	Hofmeister	from	the	files	.
We	may	need	to	have	posters	printed	up	.
Now	,	then	,	what	is	your	assessment	of	the	murder	in	the	automobile	?
So	far	,	all	I	know	is	that	the	killer	used	a	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	,	from	1906	,	production	of	which	ended	in	1916	.
This	weapon	was	fired	from	a	distance	of	not	more	than	25	feet	.
No	empty	shells	were	found	in	the	street	nor	on	the	sidewalk	,	and	the	bullet	's	trajectory	indicates	the	shot	was	not	fired	from	a	window	but	rather	from	a	point	almost	level	with	the	victim	's	head	.
We	may	therefore	conclude	the	shot	was	fired	from	another	vehicle	.
Another	vehicle	?
--------------------
That	would	be	very	interesting	indeed	.
That	opens	up	a	whole	new	perspective	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Not	bad	.
Excuse	me	,	Inspector	.
It	's	Habermann	.
This	is	about	the	Kramm	homicide	.
Inspector	,	we	've	traced	the	murder	victim	's	actions	up	until	6	:	10	on	the	evening	of	the	murder	.
Where	he	was	from	then	until	the	time	of	death	we	have	not	yet	been	able	to	establish	.
But	that	's	what	we	need	to	find	out	.
--------------------
See	that	you	find	out	where	he	was	those	last	two	hours	.
Very	well	.
Müiler	,	arrange	to	have	-	No	,	wait	.
Where	's	the	text	for	the	Kramm	homicide	poster	?
Here	it	is	.
"	All	information	will	be	kept	confidential	"
Put	another	line	in	here	:
"	Especially	concerning	the	hours	from	6	:	00	to	8	:	00	p	.	m	.	"
Have	those	changes	made	.
And	-	No	,	never	mind	.
--------------------
I	'll	do	it	myself	.
Photo	department	.
Weber	,	the	old	man	wants	to	talk	to	you	.
Trouble	?
I	don	't	know	.
Weber	here	.
I	'm	just	doing	it	now	.
Enlargements	,	naturally	.
Trace	the	scratches	and	see	if	you	can	't	link	them	together	into	a	word	or	name	or	something	.
I	'm	sure	Hofmeister	intended	to
--------------------
Inspector	,	they	found	Hofmeister	!
Where	?
The	police	station	at	Schöneberger	Ufer	.
A	police	patrol	found	him	.
At	first	they	thought	he	was	just	another	drunk	because	he	kept	babbling	to	himself	incessantly	.
But	then	they	heard	him	call	your	name	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Why	won	't	you	listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	?
Inspector	,	you	must	listen	to	me	.
It	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
--------------------
Inspector	Lohmann	,	please	listen	,	for	the	love	of	God	!
Gloria
Gloria
Lovely	are	the	maidens	in	Batavia
Between	17	and	18
My	God	!
You	see	?
The	moment	he	thinks	he	's	being	watched	,	he	starts	singing	.
When	he	thinks	he	's	alone	,	he	calls	your	name	.
I	'll	leave	you	alone	now	.
--------------------
Hofmeister	,	don	't	you	recognize	me	?
Goddamn	it	!
Hofmeister	,	it	's	me	,	Lohmann	.
Your	old	friend	Lohmann	.
My	God	!
Inspector	?
Inspector	Lohmann	?
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	?
For	God	's	sake	,	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Come	to	the	phone	!
--------------------
Hello	.
This	is	Lohmann	.
Detective	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Who	is	it	,	please	?
Inspector	?
Is	that	you	,	Hofmeister	?
This	is	Lohmann	.
Lovely	are	the	maidens
Hopeless	.
We	'll	have	no	other	choice	but	to	commit	the	poor	devil	to	an	institution	.
--------------------
Listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	?
Poor	devil	,	eh	?
Heaven	help	me	if	I	ever	get	my	hands	on	the	scoundrel	responsible	for	that	fellow	's	condition	!
All	of	a	sudden	he	stopped	writing	and	just	sat	there	like	a	living	corpse	.
Then	he	suddenly	got	an	expression	in	his	eyes	,	those	eyes	that	leave	you	practically	paralyzed	!
The	eyes	of	a	man	who
If	he	were	in	his	right	mind	,
I	believe	he	could	compel	people	to	do	his	will	right	from	his	cell	.
The	professor	must	come	.
--------------------
The	professor	is	working	and	doesn	't	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
Winkler	,	this	is	Mabuse	!
Not	so	loud	!
The	professor	will	fire	me	on	the	spot	.
I	do	not	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
With	great	disconcertment	I	have	found	out	that	in	the	Hofmeister	matter	,	surveillance	at	the	print	shop	failed	in	the	most	irresponsible	way	.
Don	't	interrupt	.
I	didn	't	ask	for	your	opinion	.
The	Hofmeister	affair	would	have	turned	into	a	catastrophe	of	the	first	order	if	not	for	the	excellent	work	of	Division	2-	B.
I	'll	come	back	to	that	later	.
--------------------
Even	so	,	in	the	future	,	all	security	measures	protecting	our	organization	will	be	made	much	more	stringent	.
Anyone	constituting	a	menace	to	our	organization	is	to	be	eliminated	without	exception	.
Kent	,	it	has	come	to	my	ears	that	you	-	perhaps	due	to	something	in	your	past	-	that	you	do	not	approve	of	certain	of	my	organization	's	measures	.
I	'm	warning	you	,	Kent	-	and	I	never	give	more	than	one	warning	-	in	the	near	future	you	will	have	to	prove	that	you	are	absolutely	committed	to	our	organization	,	and	that	you	know	what	you	are	being	paid	for	.
MURDER	-	2,	000	MARKS	REWARD
Murder	.
No	!
It	's	really	none	of	my	business	,
but	I	don	't	think	you	're	taking	the	doctor	's	warning	seriously	enough	.
Oh	,	yes	,	I	am	.
--------------------
Division	2-	B.
No	one	in	the	organization	gets	out	of	it	alive	.
It	's	hopeless	.
There	's	no	turning	back	.
"	I	must	say	farewell	forever	,	and	I	can	't	even	tell	you	why	.
But	there	's	no	other	way	for	me	to	behave	decently	towards	you	.
You	will	never	know	what	you	've	meant	in	my	botched	life	.
It	is	very	difficult	to	say	good-	bye	to	you	,	Lilli	.	"
"	Forget	me	-	though	I	shall	never	forget	you	!	"
It	spells	Mabuse	.
--------------------
What	spells	Mabuse	?
Those	scratches	on	the	windowpane	,	Inspector	.
It	took	me	forever	to	discover	he	was	writing	as	if	in	a	mirror	.
Using	his	left	hand	,	and	behind	his	back	.
If	you	flip	it	over	,	see	there	?
Quite	clear	.
Wasn	't	he	that
That	doctor	back	during	the	economic	crisis	?
Quite	right	.
Inspector	.
--------------------
I	've	got	him	.
1920	-	1921	.
Dr.	Mabuse	"	The	Gambler	.	"
Come	on	,	let	me	see	that	.
Let	's	see	what	business	he	has	being	on	that	windowpane	.
When	Lohmann	has	untied	all	the	knots	,	then	you	may	sweep	up	as	much	as	you	like	.
But	until	then	,	he	'll	go	wild	as	an	ape	if	you	touch	anything	,	and	he	bites	.
I	'd	like	to	see	him	try	.
Müiler	.
The	old	man	's	coming	.
--------------------
Get	out	!
Müiler	,	come	here	.
Call	up	G9-	19-	902	.
That	's	the	mental	hospital	run	by	Professor	Baum	where	they	committed	a	certain	Dr.	Mabuse	.
I	'd	like	to	know	if	he	's	still	there	.
When	?
Thank	you	.
Dr.	Mabuse	died	this	morning	.
This	morning	?
Today	of	all	days	.
--------------------
That	is	quite	peculiar	.
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
So	,	you	too	?
What	do	you	mean	,	me	too	?
Something	big	is	on	for	tonight	,	it	seems	.
We	've	been	called	in	,	as	have	Divisions	5	and	9	...	as	well	as	Section	2-	B.
Good	Lord	.
It	's	no	use	,	Kent	.
The	doctor	is	more	powerful	than	you	.
Is	your	curiosity	satisfied	now	,
--------------------
Inspector	?
And	this	corpse	is	clearly	identified	as	Mabuse	?
There	's	no	doubt	of	that	?
Unfortunately	not	,	Inspector	.
Unfortunately	it	is	only	too	certain	that	this	dead	man	here	is	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Or	was	.
Alas	.
This	assessment	of	the	deceased
Is	smoking	permitted	here	?
Yes	.
--------------------
seems	to	me	to	be	slightly	,	let	's	say
Do	you	smoke	?
No	,	thanks	.
let	's	say	slightly	exaggerated	.
In	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	,	we	're	not	dealing	with	a	human	being	of	value	but	with	an	evil	criminal	who	only	escaped	the	gallows	by	entering	an	insane	asylum	.
One	less	insane	criminal	in	the	world	.
Silence	!
You	have	no	idea	.
No	one	has	any	idea	what	kind	of	phenomenal	,	superhuman	mind	has	come	to	an	end	with	Dr.	Mabuse	's	death	.
This	mind	would	have	laid	waste	to	our	whole	rotten	world	,	which	is	long	overdue	for	destruction	.
--------------------
This	godless	world	,	devoid	of	justice	and	compassion	,	consisting	only	of	selfishness	,	cruelty	and	hatred	.
This	mind	would	have	destroyed	mankind	,	which	itself	knows	only	destruction	and	extermination	and	which	could	only	have	been	saved	in	its	final	hour	through	terror	and	horror	.
Mabuse	the	criminal	?
Mabuse	the	genius	!
His	intellectual	legacy	would	have	turned	your	world	,	with	its	police	protection	,	on	its	head	!
His	legacy	?
You	speak	of	Mabuse	's	legacy	?
No	.
Yes	.
Of	course	,	not	a	testament	in	the	accepted	sense	of	the	word	.
--------------------
Just	some	of	his	notes	,	of	interest	only	to	physicians	and	men	of	science	.
I	'm	afraid	,	Professor	,	that	you	underestimate	the	number	of	subjects	in	which	I	take	an	interest	.
Take	,	for	example	,	a	case	which	concerns	me	intimately	.
Wasn	't	a	young	man	admitted	to	your	institution	earlier	today	by	the	name	of	Hofmeister	?
May	I	see	that	man	?
I	'm	terribly	sorry	,	Inspector	.
That	man	seems	to	be	suffering	the	effects	of	some	frightful	experience	that	he	relives	each	time	someone	approaches	him	.
Then	he	begins	singing	like	a	frightened	child	sings	in	the	dark	.
I	must	therefore	request	,	for	the	good	of	the	patient	,	that	you	refrain	from	seeing	him	now	.
What	is	it	?
--------------------
Forgive	me	,	Professor	.
We	only	wanted	to
They	're	waiting	for	you	in	anatomy	class	.
Yes	,	of	course	.
Well	,	I	see	the	doctor	's	cell	is	already	occupied	again	.
Yes	,	the	new	one	who	arrived	last	night	.
The	professor	ordered	that	he	be	isolated	.
The	doctor	's	cell	just	became	vacant	,	so	we	put	him	in	it	.
It	's	strange	when	you	come	to	think	of	it	.
For	10	years	I	've	cared	for	the	doctor	,	and	now	he	lies	down	there	in	the	morgue	.
--------------------
Or	what	's	left	of	him	.

The	doctor	.

NOTES	BY	DR.	MABUSE
FEBRUARY	15TH	TO	MARCH	31	ST
"	The	Empire	of	Crime	.	"
The	empire	of	crime	.
"	Humanity	's	soul	must	be	shaken	to	its	very	depths	,	frightened	by	unfathomable	and	seemingly	senseless	crimes	.
Crimes	that	benefit	no	one	,	whose	only	objective	is	to	inspire	fear	and	terror	.	"
--------------------
Because	the	ultimate	purpose	of	crime	is	to	establish	the	endless	empire	of	crime	.
A	state	of	complete	insecurity	and	anarchy	,	founded	upon	the	tainted	ideals	of	a	world	doomed	to	annihilation	.
When	humanity	,	subjugated	by	the	terror	of	crime	,	has	been	driven	insane	by	fear	and	horror	,	and	when	chaos	has	become	supreme	law	,	then	the	time	will	have	come	for	the	empire	of	crime	.

Yes	,	sir	.

Repeat	that	.
"	Quadrants	E-	9	and	K-	14	.	"
--------------------
They	are	to	be	concentrated	so	as	to	spread	the	blaze	mainly	to	the	storerooms	and	depots	.
Is	that	clear	?
Yes	,	sir	.
By	the	time	the	fire	crews	arrive	,	the	flames	must	be	impossible	to	subdue	.
Division	3	and	Dr.	Hauser	to	the	boss	.

Division	3	?
Yes	.
And	Dr.	Hauser	.
Report	.
--------------------
Killed	!
There	mustn	't	be	the	slightest	clue	to	suggest	the	safes	were	opened	.
Once	everything	has	been	executed	according	to	plan	,	the	bank	's	alarms	must	be	set	off	to	simulate	a	burglary	interrupted	in	progress	.
Do	you	understand	?
Yes	,	sir	.
Division	3	is	no	longer	needed	.
I	LOVE	YOU	!
Good	evening	,	Tom	.
I	was	here	in	the	afternoon	,	too	,	but	you	weren	't	home	.
Nor	were	you	here	earlier	this	evening	.
--------------------
So	I	waited	,	Tom	,	a	terribly	long	time	.
Won	't	you	at	least	offer	me	a	seat	in	return	,	Tom	?
What	a	lovely	place	you	have	here	.
I	like	rooms	that	have	such	wide	,	tall	windows	.
Lovely	.
Is	this	true	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
But	I	wrote	to	you	!
And	I	gave	you	my	answer	,	Tom	.
But	you	don	't	even	know	who	I	am	,	Lilli	.
--------------------
My	dear	Tom	,	isn	't	that	entirely	beside	the	point	?
Beside	the	point	?
Entirely	beside	the	point	!
We	'll	see	right	now	whether	it	's	beside	the	point	!
There	you	have	it	,	in	black	and	white	-	just	who	I	am	.
Official	confirmation	with	the	seal	and	signature	of	the	prison	director	and	everything	that	goes	with	it	.
Prison	.
Yes	,	prison	!
Four	and	a	half	years	in	prison	!
The	last	six	months	commuted	for	good	behavior	.
--------------------
There	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
You	don	't	know	why	I	was	in	prison	.
I	killed	two	people	.
One	was	my	girlfriend	,	and	the	other	was	the	man	I	'd	thought	was	my	best	friend	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
Then	I	'm	forced	to	tell	you	the	rest	,	Lilli	.
I	...
--------------------
I	lied	to	you	,	Lilli	!
I	told	you	I	'd	found	a	position	,	didn	't	I	?
Well	,	I	certainly	did	.
Do	you	know	where	?
In	a	counterfeiting	lab	.
That	's	one	place	that	can	use	an	engineer	who	's	an	ex-	con	.
If	I	had	only	known	what	I	know	now	.
Along	with	destruction	of	the	crops	,	water	supplies	must	be	poisoned	.
Epidemics	of	every	kind	must	break	down	any	resistance	on	the	part	of	the	people	.
A	warning	to	unreliable	elements	will	not	be	issued	again	.
--------------------
The	slightest	sign	of	treachery	will	be	punished	immediately	by	death	.
You	see	,	Lilli	?
This	time	you	don	't	say	,
"	Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.	"
Look	,	Tom	.
When	I	received	your	letter	,
did	you	really	think	me	so	dense	that	I	wouldn	't	sense	the	despair	in	your	heart	?
I	thought	to	myself	,
"	What	he	needs	is	to	regain	his	faith	in	himself	,	to	believe	that	everything	can	turn	out	well	again	.	"
--------------------
And	I	thought	to	myself	,
"	Maybe	you	can	restore	his	faith	in	himself	if	you	tell	him	how	much	you	care	for	him	and	that	you	will	stand	by	him	for	better	or	for	worse	.	"
And	so	I	came	to	you	.
Tell	me	,	have	you	taken	it	upon	yourself	to	rob	me	of	my	last	shred	of	sanity	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
You	!
You	!
You	have	to	report	that	he	's	failed	to	show	up	.
Let	's	wait	.
Finished	.
--------------------
I	guess	I	have	no	other	choice	.
Section	2-	B	?
Yes	.
This	is	Division	3	.
I	must	report	that	Kent	didn	't	show	up	.
Believe	me	,	Tom	,	your	life	is	just	beginning	.
A	brand-	new	life	,	clean	,	spotless	and	good	.
It	's	true	,	Tom	!
We	'll	put	it	all	behind	us	and	make	a	fresh	start	.
And	you	know	who	'll	help	us	?
--------------------
Help	us	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
The	man	who	once
When	he	had	to	arrest	you	,	he	was	so	decent	and	compassionate	towards	you	.
Lohmann	?
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Voberg	is	here	.
He	claims	to	have	some	important	news	.
Give	me	a	cigar	and	raise	the	shades	.
--------------------
Then	show	him	in	.
Morning	,	Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Well	,	Inspector	,	it	's	like	this	.
Scholz	and	I	think	we	've	stumbled	across	something
Lower	those	shades	.
Clumsy	fool	.
We	stumbled	across	something	that	might	lead	us	to	the	jewelry	robbers	.
Is	that	so	?
We	saw	a	girl	running	around	with	a	big	pearl	necklace	.
--------------------
She	could	tell	me	anything	at	all	,	that	she	bought	the	thing	at	Woolworth	's	for	25	pfennigs	.
But	Scholz	knows	about	these	things	,	and	he	swears	that	necklace	is	genuine	.
Well	,	is	it	?
So	far	all	we	know	is	that	she	's	the	sweetheart	of	a	scoundrel	who	's	an	expert	on	anything	having	to	do	with	jewelry	robberies	.
Where	are	the	others	?
They	had	a	few	details	to	take	care	of	.
Come	along	,	quietly	.
Come	along	,	Kent	.
Come	on	,	let	's	go	!
Off	you	go	,	then	,	but	remember	:
--------------------
Be	careful	.
You	're	dealing	with	a	dangerous	international	crook	.
Understand	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
All	right	then	.
Good	luck	.
Good	day	,	Chief	.
Kent	!
You	were	ordered	to	prepare	the	strike	against	the	Overseas	Bank	.
You	failed	to	carry	out	your	orders	.
--------------------
Failure	to	obey	is	tantamount	to	treason	.
The	penalty	for	both	offenses	is	death	.
Let	the	woman	go	free	.
Do	with	me	what	you	like	,	but	let	her	go	free	.
You	and	that	woman	will	never	leave	this	room	alive	.
You	monster	!
Tom	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Stay	back	!
Good	God	!
You	will	never	leave	this	room	alive	.
--------------------
You	have	three	hours	left	to	live	.
What	's	that	?
Tom	,	what	's	that	?
What	's	that	,	Tom	?
Whatever	it	is	,	Lilli	,	we	must	find	it	and	put	an	end	to	it	.
You	'll	be	taking	over	Kent	's	job	,	by	the	way	.
He	won	't	be	able	to	do	it	anymore	.
What	do	you	mean	?
He	's	otherwise	engaged	.
Who	could	that	be	?
--------------------
How	do	I	know	?
Maybe	it	's	the	mailman	.
Anni	!
Wanna	go	and	see	who	that	is	?
Hold	on	.
Who	is	it	?
The	gas	man	.
I	'd	like	to	inspect	the	meter	.
Afternoon	,	miss	.
You	want	to	look	at	the	meter	?
--------------------
Come	back	some	other	time	.
I	've	got	company	right	now	.
How	dare	you	!
Police	.
Open	up	.
Look	out	!
Police	!
Don	't	shoot	!
Shut	up	,	you	idiot	!
Get	out	!
--------------------
Quick	,	out	the	back	door	!
We	don	't	have	one	!
You	idiots	get	an	apartment	with	only	one	exit	?
What	about	the	window	?
From	the	fourth	floor	?
There	must	be	some	way	out	!
Shall	I	put	in	an	elevator	for	you	guys	?
Now	we	're	really	done	for	!
That	guy	will	call	all	his	cop	friends	.
And	on	a	Sunday	,	too	.
--------------------
What	're	you	crying	about	?
It	's	your	own	damn	fault	for	firing	at	him	!
Leave	me	alone	,	you	hear	?
Stop	giving	me	a	hard	time	!
Listen	,	try	to	knock	a	hole	through	the	ceiling	.
Maybe	we	can	escape	to	the	roof	.
I	'll	try	to	hit	the	guy	and	keep	him	back	from	the	door	!
Stay	back	.
Notify	the	Special	Tactics	Squad	and	get	hold	of
Damned	scoundrel	!
--------------------
Who	should	I	get	hold	of	?
Homicide	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	'll	never	get	out	this	way	.
The	window	,	Tom	.
We	could	try	to	break	through	that	.
Cement	.
But	the	brick	,	maybe	.
Damn	it	!
--------------------
Hey	!
How	far	are	you	in	there	?
I	can	't	hold	this	door	forever	.
Lohmann	and	his	whole	gang	are	here	.
Lohmann	?
That	's	it	!
I	'm	out	!
Get	yourself	killed	,	all	of	you	!
What	do	you	mean	by	that	?
What	do	I	mean	?
--------------------
I	'll	tell	you	what	I	mean	!
Watch	the	door	!
Out	of	the	way	.
Hardy	,	be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	won	't	get	anywhere	on	the	roof	.
Let	me	talk	to	them	.
Let	me	tell	you	something	.
Anyone	who	gets	near	that	door	,	inside	or	out	,	is	gonna	get	it	,	understand	?
Go	keep	an	eye	on	them	!
--------------------
Move	it	!
Almost	.
Now	.
Let	's	see	now	.
What	's	the	matter	,	Tom	?
It	's	no	use	,	Lilli	.
Behind	those	bricks	is	a	steel	plate	.
Dear	God	!
Careful	!
A	bullet	can	cripple	you	for	life	!
--------------------
Is	he	dead	?
Karetzky	.
Goddamn	this	mess	!
Anni	,	get	some	towels	.
Come	on	,	quick	!
It	's	no	use	.
Better	keep	an	eye	on	the	door	.
Why	didn	't	you	let	me	negotiate	?
You	and	your	stupid	shooting	!
Bredow	,	shoot	anyone	who	comes	near	the	door	!
--------------------
Do	you	hear	?
You	bet	I	will	!
I	've	had	enough	of	this	business	.
I	've	got	you	now	.
Open	up	!
It	's	Lohmann	!
What	's	the	matter	?
Lohmann	's	outside	.
I	forbid	you	to	go	!
Who	are	you	to	forbid	anything	?
--------------------
I	won	't	land	in	jail	'cause	of	you	!
Think	I	'll	let	you	cowardly	swine	send	me	to	the	slaughter	?
Be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	've	got	hand	grenades	.
I	'll	give	you	one	last	chance	.
If	you	're	reasonable	,	we	'll	be	reasonable	too	.
That	's	the	way	.
Attaboy	.
Daddy	's	proud	of	you	.
--------------------
Now	,	open	the	door	and	put	your	hands	up	.
How	many	of	you	are	there	?
Five	,	Inspector	.
One	,	two	,	three	.
Diamond	Anna	!
See	you	don	't	catch	a	cold	,	my	dear	.
Four	.
Where	's	the	fifth	?
Damn	it	!
Don	't	try	anything	!
--------------------
A	Dreyse	pistol	.
What	do	you	know	?
A	Dreyse	pistol	,	no	less	.
Made	in	1906	,	7	.	65-	mm	.
Apparently	the	former	owner	-	a	friend	of	yours
No	.
No	?
That	's	funny	.
It	says	here	that	the	two	of	you	were	close	friends	.
It	's	signed	by	Karetzky	,	Diamond	Anna	,	and	her	sweetheart	.
--------------------
One	shouldn	't	forsake	a	friend	who	's	died	.
I	'm	not	forsaking	him	.
That	's	more	like	it	.
So	your	old	buddy	held	on	to	this	gun	because	he	was	used	to	it	.
Actually	,	haven	't	these	things	been	out	of	style	for	a	long	time	?
I	'm	no	gun	expert	.
That	's	right	.
You	're	more	of	an	expert	on	automobiles	.
What	make	of	car	did	Dr.	Kramm	drive	?
A	"	Hanomag	"	or	a	DKW	?
--------------------
Who	?
Dr.	Kramm	,	the	guy	you	two	rubbed	out	from	your	car	.
I	don	't	know	what	you	're	talking	about	,	Inspector	.
Is	that	so	?
Müiler	.
It	's	no	good	,	Lilli	.
I	can	't	find	a	thing	.
God	almighty	.
There	,	there	.
Steady	,	Lilli	.
--------------------
My	dear	little	Lilli	.
There	might	be	another	way	.
It	's	a	long	shot	.
What	if	we	flood	the	room	with	water	?
Water	?
Yes	.
Where	did	I
What	are	you	looking	for	,	Tom	?
My	knife	.
Water	lessens	the	force	of	an	explosion	.
--------------------
There	it	is	.
Out	of	the	way	.
It	just	might	break	through	the	wall	for	us	.
What	if	it	doesn	't	,	Tom	?
If	the	water	rises	,	and	we	're
Let	's	try	it	,	Tom	.
Here	you	are	,	Inspector	.
Thank	you	.
So	you	don	't	know	anything	about	Dr.	Kramm	's	murder	?
No	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
The	first	I	heard	of	it	was	right	here	.
Let	me	show	you	something	.
Come	here	.
Come	,	come	.
Take	a	look	at	this	still	life	.
You	're	familiar	with	this	here	.
A	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	made	in	1906	.
It	belonged	to	your	friend	.
He	shot	himself	with	it	,	didn	't	he	?
Yes	.
--------------------
Fine	.
But	do	you	know	what	's	in	there	?
No	.
Well	,	then	,	look	here	.
Take	that	magnifying	glass	and	take	a	careful	look	at	these	two	Easter	eggs	.
Well	?
See	any	difference	?
No	,	not	the	slightest	.
You	see	,	my	boy	,	that	's	just	it	!
None	of	us	police	could	detect	any	difference	either	,	neither	with	the	magnifying	glass	nor	in	the	photographs	.
--------------------
These	two	bullets	are	so	completely	identical	that	they	could	only	have	been	fired	from	the	same	gun	.
Yet	one	was	taken	from	the	skull	of	the	deceased	Dr.	Kramm	,	and	the	other	was	found	in	the	skull	of	your	dead	friend	Hardy	.
Glass	of	water	,	my	lad	?
Cigarette	.
So	now	tell	me	why	your	friend	Hardy	shot	and	killed	Dr.	Kramm	.
I	can	't	tell	you	that	,	Inspector	.
Liar	!
Kill	me	if	you	like	,	but	I	don	't	know	what	Hardy	's	orders	were	!
So	you	had	orders	?
Not	me	.
--------------------
Hardy	.
From	whom	?
I	couldn	't	tell	you	,	Inspector	.
I	've	never	seen	the	man	in	my	life	.
Now	enters	the	mystery	man	.
Come	on	in	and	pull	up	a	chair	.
Just	what	we	needed	:	the	man	in	the	shadows	.
So	you	don	't	know	the	man	's	name	?
On	my	honor	,	Inspector	,	I	don	't	know	who	gave	Hardy	those	orders	.
Then	there	's	nothing	we	can	do	.
--------------------
Dictate	for	the	record	what	you	know	about	the	whole	case	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Müiler	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
It	was	like	this	,	Mr.	Assistant	Inspector	.
I	was	just
I	was	just	washing	my	car	,	because	everything	has	to	be	in	top	shape	in	these	days	of	keen	competition	.
Suddenly	the	phone	rings	,	and	Hardy	picks	it	up	.
Then	he	came	and	said	we	were	to	catch	up	with	Dr.	Kramm	's	car	at	the	intersection	of	Körnerstrasse	and	Grüner	Winkel	.
So	we	set	out	,	of	course	,	and	pretty	soon	he	showed	up	.
--------------------
Sergeant	,	take	this	man	away	.
Isn	't	Professor	Baum	's	insane	asylum	on	Grüner	Winkel	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
So	that	's	where	Dr.	Kramm	spent	his	final	two	hours	.
Look	and	see	if	we	have	any	police	record	for	Dr.	Baum	.
Baum	-	Bertha	,	Anna	,	Ulrich	,	Max	.
Nothing	on	him	?
Well	,	that	was	-	Thank	you	.
Get	Professor	Baum	on	the	phone	for	me	.
Professor	,	it	's	police	headquarters	.
--------------------
Inspector	Lohmann	wishes	to	speak	to	you	.
This	is	Professor	Baum	.
This	man	swears	you	've	been	treating	him	for	the	last	two	months	.
I	think	he	's	just	trying	to	establish	an	alibi	.
I	'd	like	to	confront	him	with	you	.
Without	him	knowing	who	you	are	,	of	course	.
Could	you	come	over	right	away	?
Thanks	a	million	,	Professor	.
If	I	'm	on	the	right	track	now	,
I	'm	gonna	get	high	as	a	kite	tonight	!
--------------------
That	's	our	way	out	!
We	're	saved	!
Inspector	,	when	are	you	going	to	let	me	out	of	this	monkey	cage	?
My	dear	fellow	,	we	're	glad	we	've	got	you	in	there	.
But	I	've	told	you	everything	I	know	.
We	'll	see	about	that	.
Professor	,	please	.
Well	,	Professor	,	do	you	know	that	man	?
Is	he	the	one	?
No	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
I	've	definitely	never	seen	him	before	.
Just	as	I	thought	.
You	there	.
Then	I	've	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Professor	.
Sorry	to	disturb	you	,	Inspector	,	but	we	need	your	signature	here	.
I	'll	be	right	with	you	.
Pardon	me	a	moment	,	Professor	.
Perhaps	you	might	wait	in	my	office	.
Room	204	,	at	the	end	of	the	hall	.
--------------------
Thanks	.
Any	of	you	know	that	man	?
No	,	Inspector	.
No	.
Never	seen	him	before	.
Bredow	,	do	you	know	the	man	you	just	saw	with	me	?
No	,	Inspector	.
I	don	't	know	the	gentleman	.
Not	the	slightest	doubt	?
No	.
--------------------
MURDER	-	2,	000	MARKS	REWARD
Sad	business	,	isn	't	it	?
Especially	for	you	,	since	you	were	a	close	friend	of	the	victim	.
Yes	,	we	were	on	excellent	terms	as	colleagues	.
The	poor	fellow	even	visited	you	on	the	day	of	his	death	.
You	could	have	saved	us	a	lot	of	work	,	Professor	,	if	you	'd	reported	that	to	the	police	.
INFORMATlON	OF	ANY	KlND
ESPEClALLY	CONCERNlNG	THE	HOURS	FROM	6	:	00	TO	8	:	00	P.	M.
This	request	was	published	in	every	newspaper	and	posted	on	kiosks	all	over	the	city	.
I	never	read	newspapers	,	only	medical	literature	.
--------------------
And	today	's	the	first	time	I	've	been	in	town	in	four	weeks	.
Dr.	Kramm	came	to	look	something	up	in	a	scientific	book	in	my
library	.
He	left	in	the	best	of	spirits	.
As	for	his	death	,	it	's	as	much	a	mystery	to	me	as	it	is	to	you	.
Then	I	'm	terribly	sorry	to	have	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Why	,	it	's	Kent	!
Do	you	know	him	?
Who	?
Him	.
--------------------
I	asked	you	if	you	knew	him	.
Where	would	I	know	him	from	?
I	have	no	idea	,	yet	you	just	spoke	his	name	.
I	did	?
That	was	you	,	Inspector	.
Inspector	,	I	must	speak	to	you	.
It	's	terribly	urgent	.
I	suppose	I	may	leave	,	Inspector	?
My	time	is
Of	course	.
--------------------
By	all	means	,	Professor	.
Just	a	moment	,	Kent	.
Many	thanks	for	coming	.
Don	't	mention	it	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
Inspector	,	please	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
Go	on	in	.
It	's	all	right	.
It	's	tremendously	important	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
--------------------
This	is	crucial	:
Do	you	know	that	man	who	just	left	?
No	.
Are	you	certain	?
I	'm	certain	.
Yet	I	could	swear	he	knew	you	.
Most	certainly	not	.
I	've	never	seen	him	before	.
Damn	it	!
What	happened	to	you	,	for	God	's	sake	?
--------------------
That	's	why	we	've	come	.
And	what	is	the	name	of	this	"	boss	"	you	mention	?
Dr.	Mabuse	.
Goddamn	it	!
Mabuse	again	!
That	fellow	is	dead	!
He	's	alive	and	kicking	,	I	tell	you	.
I	saw	the	cadaver	myself	.
Bless	you	.
It	's	true	.
--------------------
I	'm	telling	you	,	he	's	not	dead	.
I	think	the	two	of	us	are	living	proof	of	that	,	though	as	for	"	living	,	"	that	was	pure	luck	!
Inspector	,	I	put	myself	completely	in	your	hands	.
Last	night	...
I	could	have	fled	but	I	didn	't	,	because	I	realized	this	is	about	more	than	my	life	or	liberty	.
My	God	,	how	can	I	convince	you	?
Is	this	proof	enough	for	you	?
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
Typewritten	.
That	's	no	proof	.
--------------------
Someone	else	could	have
"	Someone	else	"	?
I	'm	not	in	for	anybody	.
No	exceptions	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
All	the	evidence	leads	again	and	again	to	that	insane	asylum	.
Müiler	,	get	the	car	.
I	may	be	putting	my	neck	on	the	line	,	but	I	'm	going	out	there	once	more	,	and	you	're	going	with	me	,	Kent	.
Perhaps	you	're	right	and
Mabuse	is	still	alive	.
--------------------
I	'd	like	to	speak	with	Professor	Baum	.
I	'm	afraid	that	's	impossible	.
The	professor	can	see	no	one	.
Just	tell	him	that	Police	Inspector	Lohmann	wishes	to	see	him	.
Gentlemen	,	it	's	really	impossible	.
The	professor	gave	strict	orders	not	to	disturb	him	.
My	good	man	,	I	must	speak	with	him	.
Now	go	on	and	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector	-	-	Will	you	announce	me	or	not	?
I	have	strict	instructions	-	-	Fine	.
--------------------
Don	't	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector
I	do	not	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
That	's	him	!
That	's	his	voice	!
What	?
That	's	the	boss	's	voice	.
I	'd	recognize	it	anywhere	.
That	's	the	man	!
Where	is	the	man	whose	voice	we	just	heard	?
--------------------
Kent	,	come	over	here	.
What	is	it	?
I	do	not	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
I	clearly	said	I	did	not	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
That	's	his	voice	.
Nice	little	contraption	.
Very	clever	.
No	wonder	you	failed	to	recognize	the	man	's	voice	.
You	only	heard	a	mechanical	reproduction	of	it	.
The	professor	?
--------------------
Baum	.
Of	course	.
But	where	is	he	hiding	?
What	's	this	?
A	map	of	the	northern	part	of	town	?
That	must	be	the	Löhr	&	Stegerwald	chemical	factory	.
CHEMlCAL	PLANT	-	OCTOBER	15TH
And	today	's	date	.
Strange	.
Very	strange	.
--------------------
What	's	one	to	make	of	that	?
There	's	something	else	here	.
It	's	in	pencil	.
8	:	30	p	.	m	.	,	and	today	's	date	.
It	's	now	9	:	10	.
Kent	,	call	the	chemical	plant	.
There	won	't	be	anyone	there	,	but	they	must	have	guards	.
And	here	's	something	else	.
"	Notes	by	Dr.	Mabuse	"	?
Isn	't	that	interesting	.
--------------------
Go	ahead	.
Good	Lord	!
The	chemical	factory	!
"	Fires	started	in	this	manner	in	a	chemical	factory	's	storerooms	cannot	be	extinguished	by	firefighters	.
Tanks	exploding	from	the	heat	will	quickly	release	immense	quantities	of	poisonous	gas	into	surrounding	areas	of	the	city	.	"
Damn	it	!
They	're	playing	cards	again	instead	of	keeping	guard	.
Here	's	your	line	,	Inspector	.
Police	headquarters	?
Inspector	Lohmann	.
--------------------
Lohmann	,	look	!
What	?
In	the	light	there	!
Quiet	.
Over	there	!
Nothing	.
Damn	it	!
There	.
Krause	!
Where	's	my	driver	?
--------------------
Krause	!
Where	is	that	guy	?
Krause	!
I	'll	drive	,	Inspector	.
Push	that	car	out	of	the	way	.
I	just	hope	this	piece	of	junk	can	make	it	.
Faster	,	faster	!
Come	on	!

Those	are	the	girls	who	carry	dead	police	inspectors	directly	up	to	heaven	from	the	Alexanderplatz	with	a	"	Hey	ho	.	"
On	horseback	.
Horseback	?
Certainly	.
Expenses	don	't	allow	for	a	car	.
Well	,	Inspector	,	when	it	comes	to	corpses	,	the	state	sometimes	has	...	a	fit	of	generosity	.
--------------------
That	's	what	you	think	.
Believe	it	or	not	,	Müiler	,	tonight	will	be	the	first	time
I	make	it	to	the	theater	in	time	for	the	first	act	.
Knock	on	wood	,	Inspector	.
There	.
What	did	I	tell	you	?
Tell	'em	I	'm	dead	.
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Inspector	.
--------------------
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Hofmeister	would	like	to	speak	with	you	,	Inspector	.
What	?
Our	former	colleague	who	got	into	trouble	with	foreign	currency	?
That	scoundrel	?
Tell	him	his	call	is	the	most	shameless	affront
I	've	ever	experienced	!
And	tell	him	to	go	to	hell	!
I	'm	sorry	,	but	Inspector	Lohmann	has	already	left	and	he	says	you
--------------------
And	he	says	you	can	go	to	hell	!
God	help	me	!
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	Müiler	.
I	once	had	high	hopes	for	that	fellow	Hofmeister	.
I	gave	him	his	first	chance	.
And	what	does	the	scoundrel	do	?
He	takes	a	bribe	from	a	black-	market	currency	trader	.
Phooey	!
The	man	I	would	have	staked	my	life	for	disgraces	me	by	getting	fired	from	the	service
like	a	bad	egg	.
--------------------
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
He	has	to	hear	me	out	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Tell	him	it	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	,	I	think	you	really	ought	to
Of	course	I	'll	miss	the	first	act	again	!
I	want	to	redeem	myself	in	his	eyes	!
I	finally	figured	out	their	scheme	.
It	's	a	monstrous	business	!
They	've	nearly	done	me	in	three	times	!
--------------------
I	hardly	dare	cross	the	street	!
Lohmann	speaking	.
What	is	it	?
Inspector	?
Thank	you	.
Cut	out	the	nonsense	and	tell	me	what	's	wrong	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
I	've	finally	discovered
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
Just	in	case	,	Inspector	,	please	have	a	record	made	of	my	report	.
--------------------
Headphones	.
Take	this	down	.
I	was	actually	tracing	counterfeit	money	.
I	wanted	to	redeem	myself	in	your	eyes	,	Inspector	.
For	four	days	-	96	hours
I	lay	up	there	at	the	air	vent	,	and	now	I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	.
But	you	'll	probably	think	I	'm	crazy	.
Who	is	it	?
I	swear	I	'm	telling	the	truth	.
I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	!
--------------------
I	heard	his	name	with	my	own	ears	!
And	now	they	know	I	know	the	name	.
Can	you	trace	that	call	?
For	God	's	sake	!
Hofmeister	!
What	street	?
Number	23	?
Thanks	.
Dear	God	.
He	must	have	gone	out	of	his	mind	from	terror	.

Exposure	to	catastrophes	such	as	explosions	,	earthquakes	and	railway	accidents	-	in	short	,	exposure	to	fright	and	horror	often	triggers	insanity	.
Perhaps	the	most	interesting	case	of	such	pathological	conditions	is	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Here	he	goes	again	.
I	shall	briefly	recount	the	history	of	this	case	.
The	patient	lived	a	decidedly	double	life	.
He	was	a	renowned	doctor	with	a	large	private	practice	.
Aided	by	an	almost	superhuman	logic	,	he	used	his	profound	knowledge	of	hypnosis	to	commit	crimes	of	a	magnitude	previously	deemed	impossible	.
For	months	the	police	sought	the	mastermind	behind	those	crimes	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	.
At	last	they	discovered	his	whereabouts	.
--------------------
But	Mabuse	decided	not	to	flee	but	rather	to	mount	armed	resistance	,	and	he	barricaded	himself	in	his	house	with	four	loyal	henchmen	.
He	refused	demands	to	surrender	to	state	authorities	,	saying	,
"	I	am	the	state	!	"
A	barrage	of	bullets	forced	the	police	to	retreat	.
Finally	,	soldiers	stormed	the	house	with	hand	grenades	.
Two	of	the	defenders	were	killed	.
Two	were	captured	.
Mabuse	,	however	,	had	disappeared	.
One	prisoner	revealed	his	hiding	place	:	a	counterfeiting	lab	from	which	he	planned	to	launch	a	massive	attack	on	the	German	currency	system	.
The	police	force	their	way	in	to	seize	him	only	to	find	he	had	gone	hopelessly	insane	.
--------------------
Then	,	sentences	began	to	form	,	still	meaningless	and	confused	.
Gradually	they	grew	more	coherent	and	logical	,	and	at	last	we	began	to	get	glimpses	into	the	extraordinary	phenomenon	that	was	his	mind	.
His	thoughts	still	move	in	the	same	criminal	channels	as	before	.
Whatever	Mabuse	writes	is	based	upon	incontrovertible	logic	and	serves	as	a	perfect	guide	for	the	commission	of	crimes	worked	out	to	the	minutest	detail	.
No	.
Nothing	can	happen	to	us	if	we	follow	the	doctor	's	methods	.
Oh	,	yeah	?
What	do	you	mean	,	"	oh	,	yeah	"	?
The	first	attacks	on	the	snitch	failed	.
So	what	?
--------------------
Tough	luck	.
So	we	called	in	Division	2-	B	to	handle	the	matter	.
If	they	succeed	,	fine	.
And	if	they	don	't	-	if	it	looks	like	that	snitch	might	rat	on	us	-	one	single	phone	call	and	this	whole	place	gets	blown	sky-	high	.
Stop	scratching	,	Fritzi	.
It	won	't	come	to	that	.
Before	that	guy	can	open	his	mouth	,	he	'll	be	done	for	.
I	'd	feel	better	if	they	didn	't	resort	to	murder	.
What	do	you	mean	,	murder	?
A	guy	can	have	something	fall	on	his	head	,	can	't	he	?
--------------------
A	nice	,	clean	little	accident	.
I	don	't	care	how	you	make	it	look	.
I	just	don	't	want	anything	to	do	with	murder	.
Scared	?
Can	't	bear	the	sight	of	blood	?
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	though	it	's	really	none	of	your	damn	business	.
I	've	killed	two	people	.
I	know	what	it	means	to	kill	.
And	that	's	precisely	why
I	want	nothing	to	do	with	murder	.
--------------------
Leave	him	alone	,	Fritzi	.
What	do	you	know	about	Kent	?
The	phone	!
Yeah	?
It	's	been	taken	care	of	?
Bravo	!
Really	?
Just	20	minutes	later	?
Lohmann	himself	?
Continue	writing	.
--------------------
Hofmeister	himself	has	disappeared	.
The	rug	has	been	moved	toward	the	window	.
He	was	on	the	phone	when	the	lights	went	out	.
Where	's	the	light	switch	?
Here	by	the	door	.
So	it	came	from	over	there	,	the	unknown	horror	,	the	thing	that	caused	his	mind	to	snap	.
And	he	backed	away	from	it	step	by	step	,	right	up	to	the	window	.
I	wonder	if	he
No	,	he	couldn	't	get	out	this	way	.
Certainly	not	downward	.
--------------------
Well	,	I	'll	be	damned	!
Actual	letters	scratched	into	the	glass	with	a	ring	.
So	he	was	trying	to	tell	me	something	.
Is	that	a	W	?
No	.
Could	it	be	a	name	?
It	may	take	us	a	while	to	figure	that	one	out	.
Hey	,	Krüger	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Take	this	pane	of	glass	to	my	office	at	headquarters	.
--------------------
And	see	that	you	don	't	break	it	,	or	I	'll	bite	your	head	off	.
That	's	odd	.
I	wonder	what	's	behind	that	.
Thirty	pages	today	,	Professor	.
Thank	you	.
Keep	a	careful	eye	on	him	tonight	.
I	don	't	like	his	pulse	.
In	any	case	,	give	him	a	shot	later	so	he	can	get	some	rest	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
Their	famous	chocolate	shake	?
--------------------
And	a	double	mocha	for	you	,	sir	?
With	hot	cream	.
As	usual	.
Very	well	.
And	now	tell	me	,	Tom	.
Why	did	you	ask	to	see	me	so	urgently	today	?
Don	't	you	know	what	today	is	,	Lilli	?
Today	?
Too	bad	.
Won	't	you	tell	me	?
--------------------
Certainly	.
A	chocolate	shake	and	a	double	mocha	with	hot	cream	.
Well	,	Tom	?
You	ask	what	day	this	is	?
Exactly	one	year	ago	today	,
No	smoking	,	gentlemen	.
Smoking	is	prohibited	.
Good	heavens	,	my	friend	,	are	you	back	again	?
I	've	told	you	a	hundred	times	there	's	no	point	in	coming	every	day	.
When	we	have	work	for	you	,	we	'll	certainly	notify	you	.
--------------------
I	've	been	waiting	for	three	months	!
Be	reasonable	.
Reasonable	?
What	does	reasonable	mean	when	a	man	is	going	under	?
I	want	to	work	!
But	they	keep	pushing	me	closer	to	the	edge	!
It	's	enough	to	drive	a	man	to	crime	!
He	's	forced	to	become	a	criminal	!
He	marches	in	here	and	causes	a	riot	!
Don	't	get	so	worked	up	.
--------------------
We	have	others	to	attend	to	.
Come	now	.
Leave	him	alone	.
He	's	sick	.
Come	now	.
Don	't	touch	me	!
I	'll	go	on	my	own	!
You	'll	never	see	me	again	here	!
Next	,	please	.
You	've	seen	the	last	of	me	!
--------------------
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
I	can	't	bear	to	see	you	leave	like	this	.
Here	are	20	marks	.
It	's	all	I	have	right	now	,	but	I	'd	like	you	to	have	it	.
It	may	help	you	out	.
I	don	't	want	charity	.
I	want	work	,	not	a	handout	.
It	's	not	a	handout	.
It	's	just	a	loan	.
I	'm	sure	you	'll	be	able	to	pay	me	back	.
--------------------
Please	.
Yes	.
And	six	months	later	,	you	found	work	and	promptly	paid	back	my	20	marks	.
Tell	me	,	Lilli	...
have	you	ever	been	in	love	?
It	's	high	time	I	was	going	.
Here	comes	my	bus	.
Please	stay	.
I	can	't	.
I	've	got	to	run	.
--------------------
Good-	bye	,	Tom	.
Call	me	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
If	you	'll	be	seated	,	Doctor	,	the	professor	is	due	back	any	moment	.
Thanks	,	Winkler	.
I	'm	sure	I	'll	find	what	I	need	.
Ah	,	I	see	it	's	on	his	desk	.
Oops	.
Oh	,	dear	!
--------------------
What	order	does	all	this	go	in	?
This	junk	isn	't	even	numbered	.
What	is	this	anyway	?
NOTES	BY	DR.	MABUSE	SEPTEMBER	1	ST	-	OCTOBER	31	ST
How	does	this	go	together	now	?
No	,	the	other	way	around	.
Then	this	page	.
What	's	the	next	part	?
"	Jewel	-	"
No	.
--------------------
"	Jewel
ry	store	.	"
"	Jewelry	store	...	specializing	in	high-	quality	...	"
What	?
"	The	least	conspicuous	and	therefore	most	effective	precaution	to	prevent	interruption	by	police	,	pedestrians	and	clients	is	to	pull	the	shades	and	hang	a	sign	on	the	door	:
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
Well	,	I	'll	be	!
"	The	criminals	then	lowered	the	shades	and	hung	a	sign	outside	the	door	,
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
If	that	isn	't	something	!
--------------------
That	's	incredible	!
"	lmmobilize	the	staff	by	using	gas	in	bulbs	of	thin	glass	,	which	will	burst	almost	inaudibly	when	tossed	.	"
Gas	!
Amazing	!
Identical	,	almost	to	the	word	!
"	The	criminals	appear	to	have	tossed	bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
"	Bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
If	that	isn	't	odd	!
It	's	as	if	they	were	following	a	blueprint	!
What	are	you	doing	there	?
--------------------
Baum	.
This	is	the	most	incredible	thing	you	could	imagine	.
Look	here	.
What	is	this	?
Where	did	you	get	these	papers	?
Never	mind	that	!
You	know	what	they	are	?
Yes	,	of	course	.
Now	read	this	.
"	Ingenious	jewelry	heist	...	"
--------------------
That	's	right	.
Read	it	.
"	Jewelry	stolen	valued	at	250,	000	marks	.
Gas	was	used	on	the	employees	.	"
Yes	,	just	as	if	they	were	following	your	Dr.	Mabuse	's	instructions	.
A	curious	coincidence	.
Now	wait	just	a	minute	.
You	call	that	a	coincidence	?
What	else	?
Baum	,	old	man	,	coincidences	like	that	just	don	't	happen	.
--------------------
There	's	some	connection	in	all	this	or	I	'll	eat	my	hat	.
Say	,	I	've	got	a	crazy	idea	.
Could	this	Mabuse	fellow	be	faking	it	?
Maybe	the	guy	isn	't	insane	after	all	.
Tell	me	,	do	you	think	that	,	after	treating	a	patient	for	years	,
I	can	't	judge	whether	he	's	really	sick	or	just	pretending	?
I	didn	't	mean	it	like	that	.
But	there	must	be	something	behind	all	this	.
You	know	what	a	genius	this	fellow	was	.
It	's	just	possible	that	his	dead	brain	has	come	back	to	life	.
--------------------
Couldn	't	Mabuse	be	writing	these	things	as	a	sort	of	blueprint	for	a	gang	of	accomplices	?
You	've	always	had	a	wild	imagination	.
Just	hear	me	out	.
What	if	Mabuse	,	with	his	incredible	hypnotic	powers	,	engaged	in	some	kind	of	telepathic	hypnosis	from	his	cell	?
Nonsense	!
Nonsense	?
Say	what	you	like	,	but	there	's	something	weird	going	on	!
Who	else	besides	you	knows	about	Mabuse	's	notes	?
You	sound	just	like	a	policeman	.
I	think	the	police	should	be	informed	of	this	strange	coincidence	.
--------------------
The	police	?
Of	course	!
Well	,	perhaps
Of	course	you	're	right	.
The	police	would	want	to	know	of	this	.
Of	course	!
I	'll	go	to	them	at	once	.
If	I	can	,	I	'll	call	you	from	the	station	.
Good-	bye	.
Please	drive	carefully	,	Doctor	.
--------------------
It	's	been	raining	.
Thank	you	,	Winkler	.
Good-	bye	.

INGENlOUS	JEWELRY	HElST
STOLEN	JEWELRY	VALUED	AT	250,	000	MARKS
Almost	a	quarter	million	in	jewels	.
Pearls	,	platinum	,	gold	.
One	can	do	a	lot	with	that	.
Can	?
Could	!
--------------------
But	what	will	be	done	with	it	?
What	's	gonna	happen	with	that	quarter	million	?
Careful	.
I	ask	you
Will	you	stay	down	?
What	becomes	of	it	,	I	ask	you	?
We	buy	cocaine	with	it	,	morphine	,	heroin	,	opium	,	whatever	you	call	all	that	crap	.
And	instead	of	making	a	killing	off	the	dope	and	fleecing	the	types	who	are	crazy	for	the	stuff	,	they	practically	give	it	away	.
What	good	does	it	do	the	boss	to	pump	the	world	full	of	dope	and	not	make	any	money	off	it	?
These	things	won	't	stay	down	.
--------------------
What	does	it	get	him	?
I	follow	his	instructions	and	drive	ten	people	nearly	crazy	with	threats	and	blackmail	.
And	when	they	're	ready	to	pay	any	sum	we	ask	,	then	I	'm	told	to	back	off	and	forget	about	the	money	.
Only	result	is	they	're	driven	crazy	from	fear	of	a	scandal	.
Is	that	any	business	of	yours	,	old	boy	?
Did	you	ever	fail	to	get	your	pay	on	time	?
That	's	not	what	I	'm	saying	.
Okay	,	then	.
You	handle	the	blackmail	,	and	I	see	to	your	alibi	.
We	get	our	paychecks	like	clockwork	,	so	what	are	you	growling	about	?
--------------------
I	'm	not	growling	.
I	just	don	't	get	it	.
If	a	woman	throws	herself	out	the	window	,	or	a	fellow	blows	his	brains	out	,	like	that	bank	director	,	blackmail	letters	aren	't	of	much	use	.
150	grand	tossed	in	the	gutter	.
Is	there	any	sense	in	that	?
Or	take	the	new	instructions	about	the	explosives	,	and	stealing	poison	from	drugstores	-	that	's	scary	business	.
As	it	's	meant	to	be	,	my	dear	fellow	.
But	why	,	in	the	devil	's	name	?
I	think	you	ask	too	many	questions	.
The	boss	doesn	't	like	that	.
--------------------
What	?
You	know	him	?
No	more	than	you	do	,	or	anyone	else	in	our	gang	.
And	I	'm	not	the	least	bit	curious	.
I	learned	my	lesson	from	your	predecessor	.
He	just	had	to	find	out	what	the	man	looked	like	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	,	the	boss	.
So	one	day	,	without	having	been	summoned	,
Cut	it	out	,	man	.
You	're	spoiling	my	appetite	.
Let	me	give	you	a	tip	.
--------------------
Let	the	boss	worry	about	this	stuff	.
We	're	well	paid	.
In	fact	,	very	well	paid	.
If	something	goes	wrong	,	we	'll	have	cast-	iron	alibis	or	a	top-	notch	lawyer	.
The	boss	thinks	of	everything	and	takes	care	of	everything	and	demands	not	a	penny	for	himself	of	all	the	loot	.
Not	a	penny	.
See	?
That	's	just	it	.
Why	?
Why	doesn	't	he	take	a	single	penny	for	himself	?
--------------------
I	can	't	understand	that	,	and	that	's	what	's	got	me	jumpy	.
Lots	of	others	in	our	gang	probably	feel	the	same	and	would	like	to	be	done	with	the	whole	thing	but	just	don	't	know	how	.
"	Dearest	Lilli	,	you	dashed	off	so	quickly	this	afternoon	that	I	had	no	chance	to	say	what	I	wanted	to	tell	you	.
I	-	"
TONlGHT	AT	1	:	00	A.	M.	-	DR.	MABUSE
Inspector	Lohmann	asks	if	you	had	the	hospitals	searched	.
A	special	squad	did	that	,	and	Hofmeister	hasn	't	been	admitted	anywhere	?
Damn	it	!
You	'll	call	back	?
Wait	a	minute	.
--------------------
Get	a	picture	of	Hofmeister	from	the	files	.
We	may	need	to	have	posters	printed	up	.
Now	,	then	,	what	is	your	assessment	of	the	murder	in	the	automobile	?
So	far	,	all	I	know	is	that	the	killer	used	a	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	,	from	1906	,	production	of	which	ended	in	1916	.
This	weapon	was	fired	from	a	distance	of	not	more	than	25	feet	.
No	empty	shells	were	found	in	the	street	nor	on	the	sidewalk	,	and	the	bullet	's	trajectory	indicates	the	shot	was	not	fired	from	a	window	but	rather	from	a	point	almost	level	with	the	victim	's	head	.
We	may	therefore	conclude	the	shot	was	fired	from	another	vehicle	.
Another	vehicle	?
That	would	be	very	interesting	indeed	.
That	opens	up	a	whole	new	perspective	.
--------------------
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Not	bad	.
Excuse	me	,	Inspector	.
It	's	Habermann	.
This	is	about	the	Kramm	homicide	.
Inspector	,	we	've	traced	the	murder	victim	's	actions	up	until	6	:	10	on	the	evening	of	the	murder	.
Where	he	was	from	then	until	the	time	of	death	we	have	not	yet	been	able	to	establish	.
But	that	's	what	we	need	to	find	out	.
See	that	you	find	out	where	he	was	those	last	two	hours	.
Very	well	.
--------------------
Müiler	,	arrange	to	have	-	No	,	wait	.
Where	's	the	text	for	the	Kramm	homicide	poster	?
Here	it	is	.
"	All	information	will	be	kept	confidential	"
Put	another	line	in	here	:
"	Especially	concerning	the	hours	from	6	:	00	to	8	:	00	p	.	m	.	"
Have	those	changes	made	.
And	-	No	,	never	mind	.
I	'll	do	it	myself	.

Weber	,	the	old	man	wants	to	talk	to	you	.
Trouble	?
I	don	't	know	.
Weber	here	.
I	'm	just	doing	it	now	.
Enlargements	,	naturally	.
Trace	the	scratches	and	see	if	you	can	't	link	them	together	into	a	word	or	name	or	something	.
I	'm	sure	Hofmeister	intended	to
Inspector	,	they	found	Hofmeister	!
Where	?
--------------------
The	police	station	at	Schöneberger	Ufer	.
A	police	patrol	found	him	.
At	first	they	thought	he	was	just	another	drunk	because	he	kept	babbling	to	himself	incessantly	.
But	then	they	heard	him	call	your	name	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Why	won	't	you	listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	?
Inspector	,	you	must	listen	to	me	.
It	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	Lohmann	,	please	listen	,	for	the	love	of	God	!
My	God	!
--------------------
You	see	?
The	moment	he	thinks	he	's	being	watched	,	he	starts	singing	.
When	he	thinks	he	's	alone	,	he	calls	your	name	.
I	'll	leave	you	alone	now	.
Hofmeister	,	don	't	you	recognize	me	?
Goddamn	it	!
Hofmeister	,	it	's	me	,	Lohmann	.
Your	old	friend	Lohmann	.
My	God	!
Inspector	?
--------------------
Inspector	Lohmann	?
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	?
For	God	's	sake	,	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Come	to	the	phone	!
Hello	.
This	is	Lohmann	.
Detective	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Who	is	it	,	please	?
Inspector	?
Is	that	you	,	Hofmeister	?
--------------------
This	is	Lohmann	.
Hopeless	.
We	'll	have	no	other	choice	but	to	commit	the	poor	devil	to	an	institution	.
Listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	?
Poor	devil	,	eh	?
Heaven	help	me	if	I	ever	get	my	hands	on	the	scoundrel	responsible	for	that	fellow	's	condition	!
All	of	a	sudden	he	stopped	writing	and	just	sat	there	like	a	living	corpse	.
Then	he	suddenly	got	an	expression	in	his	eyes	,
If	he	were	in	his	right	mind	,
--------------------
I	believe	he	could	compel	people	to	do	his	will	right	from	his	cell	.
The	professor	must	come	.
The	professor	is	working	and	doesn	't	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
Winkler	,	this	is	Mabuse	!
Not	so	loud	!
The	professor	will	fire	me	on	the	spot	.

Murder	.
No	!
It	's	really	none	of	my	business	,	but	I	don	't	think	you	're	taking	the	doctor	's	warning	seriously	enough	.

Oh	,	yes	,	I	am	.

No	one	in	the	organization	gets	out	of	it	alive	.
It	's	hopeless	.

But	there	's	no	other	way	for	me	to	behave	decently	towards	you	.
You	will	never	know	what	you	've	meant	in	my	botched	life	.
It	is	very	difficult	to	say	good-	bye	to	you	,	Lilli	.	"
"	Forget	me	-	though	I	shall	never	forget	you	!	"
It	spells	Mabuse	.

What	spells	Mabuse	?
Those	scratches	on	the	windowpane	,	Inspector	.
It	took	me	forever	to	discover	he	was	writing	as	if	in	a	mirror	.
Using	his	left	hand	,	and	behind	his	back	.
If	you	flip	it	over	,	see	there	?
Quite	clear	.
Wasn	't	he	that
Quite	right	.
Inspector	.
I	've	got	him	.
--------------------
1920	-	1921	.
Dr.	Mabuse	"	The	Gambler	.	"
Come	on	,	let	me	see	that	.
Let	's	see	what	business	he	has	being	on	that	windowpane	.
then	you	may	sweep	up	as	much	as	you	like	.
But	until	then	,	he	'll	go	wild	as	an	ape	if	you	touch	anything	,	and	he	bites	.
I	'd	like	to	see	him	try	.
The	old	man	's	coming	.
Get	out	!
Müiler	,	come	here	.
--------------------
Call	up	G9-	19-	902	.
That	's	the	mental	hospital	run	by	Professor	Baum	where	they	committed	a	certain	Dr.	Mabuse	.
I	'd	like	to	know	if	he	's	still	there	.
When	?
Thank	you	.
Dr.	Mabuse	died	this	morning	.
This	morning	?
Today	of	all	days	.
That	is	quite	peculiar	.
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
--------------------
So	,	you	too	?
What	do	you	mean	,	me	too	?
Something	big	is	on	for	tonight	,	it	seems	.
We	've	been	called	in	,	as	have	Divisions	5	and	9	...	as	well	as	Section	2-	B.
Good	Lord	.
It	's	no	use	,	Kent	.
The	doctor	is	more	powerful	than	you	.
Is	your	curiosity	satisfied	now	,
Inspector	?
And	this	corpse	is	clearly	identified	as	Mabuse	?
--------------------
There	's	no	doubt	of	that	?
Unfortunately	not	,	Inspector	.
Unfortunately	it	is	only	too	certain	that	this	dead	man	here	is	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Or	was	.
Alas	.
This	assessment	of	the	deceased
Is	smoking	permitted	here	?
Yes	.
seems	to	me	to	be	slightly	,	let	's	say
Do	you	smoke	?
--------------------
No	,	thanks	.
let	's	say	slightly	exaggerated	.
In	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	,	we	're	not	dealing	with	a	human	being	of	value	but	with	an	evil	criminal	who	only	escaped	the	gallows	by	entering	an	insane	asylum	.
One	less	insane	criminal	in	the	world	.
Silence	!
You	have	no	idea	.
No	one	has	any	idea	what	kind	of	phenomenal	,	superhuman	mind	has	come	to	an	end	with	Dr.	Mabuse	's	death	.
This	mind	would	have	laid	waste	to	our	whole	rotten	world	,	which	is	long	overdue	for	destruction	.
This	godless	world	,	devoid	of	justice	and	compassion	,	consisting	only	of	selfishness	,	cruelty	and	hatred	.
This	mind	would	have	destroyed	mankind	,	which	itself	knows	only	destruction	and	extermination	and	which	could	only	have	been	saved	in	its	final	hour	through	terror	and	horror	.
--------------------
Mabuse	the	criminal	?
Mabuse	the	genius	!
His	intellectual	legacy	would	have	turned	your	world	,	with	its	police	protection	,	on	its	head	!
His	legacy	?
You	speak	of	Mabuse	's	legacy	?
No	.
Yes	.
Of	course	,	not	a	testament	in	the	accepted	sense	of	the	word	.
Just	some	of	his	notes	,	of	interest	only	to	physicians	and	men	of	science	.
I	'm	afraid	,	Professor	,	that	you	underestimate	the	number	of	subjects	in	which	I	take	an	interest	.
--------------------
Take	,	for	example	,	a	case	which	concerns	me	intimately	.
Wasn	't	a	young	man	admitted	to	your	institution	earlier	today	by	the	name	of	Hofmeister	?
May	I	see	that	man	?
I	'm	terribly	sorry	,	Inspector	.
That	man	seems	to	be	suffering	the	effects	of	some	frightful	experience	that	he	relives	each	time	someone	approaches	him	.
Then	he	begins	singing	like	a	frightened	child	sings	in	the	dark	.
I	must	therefore	request	,	for	the	good	of	the	patient	,	that	you	refrain	from	seeing	him	now	.
What	is	it	?
Forgive	me	,	Professor	.
We	only	wanted	to
--------------------
They	're	waiting	for	you	in	anatomy	class	.
Yes	,	of	course	.
Well	,	I	see	the	doctor	's	cell	is	already	occupied	again	.
Yes	,	the	new	one	who	arrived	last	night	.
The	professor	ordered	that	he	be	isolated	.
The	doctor	's	cell	just	became	vacant	,	so	we	put	him	in	it	.
It	's	strange	when	you	come	to	think	of	it	.
For	10	years	I	've	cared	for	the	doctor	,	and	now	he	lies	down	there	in	the	morgue	.
Or	what	's	left	of	him	.

The	empire	of	crime	.
"	Humanity	's	soul	must	be	shaken	to	its	very	depths	,	frightened	by	unfathomable	and	seemingly	senseless	crimes	.
Crimes	that	benefit	no	one	,	whose	only	objective	is	to	inspire	fear	and	terror	.	"

When	humanity	,	subjugated	by	the	terror	of	crime	,	has	been	driven	insane	by	fear	and	horror	,	and	when	chaos	has	become	supreme	law	,	then	the	time	will	have	come	for	the	empire	of	crime	.

And	Dr.	Hauser	.
Per	my	orders	,	the	letters	incriminating	the	signatory	of	the	Overseas	Bank	were	not	returned	to	him	,	even	when	very	large	sums	were	offered	,	until	he	agreed	to	comply	completely	with	our	demands	.

--------------------
I	LOVE	YOU	!
Good	evening	,	Tom	.
I	was	here	in	the	afternoon	,	too	,	but	you	weren	't	home	.
Nor	were	you	here	earlier	this	evening	.
So	I	waited	,	Tom	,	a	terribly	long	time	.
Won	't	you	at	least	offer	me	a	seat	in	return	,	Tom	?
What	a	lovely	place	you	have	here	.
I	like	rooms	that	have	such	wide	,	tall	windows	.
Lovely	.
Is	this	true	?
--------------------
Yes	,	Tom	.
But	I	wrote	to	you	!
And	I	gave	you	my	answer	,	Tom	.
But	you	don	't	even	know	who	I	am	,	Lilli	.
My	dear	Tom	,	isn	't	that	entirely	beside	the	point	?
Beside	the	point	?
Entirely	beside	the	point	!
We	'll	see	right	now	whether	it	's	beside	the	point	!
There	you	have	it	,	in	black	and	white	-	just	who	I	am	.
Official	confirmation	with	the	seal	and	signature	of	the	prison	director	and	everything	that	goes	with	it	.
--------------------
Prison	.
Yes	,	prison	!
Four	and	a	half	years	in	prison	!
The	last	six	months	commuted	for	good	behavior	.
There	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
You	don	't	know	why	I	was	in	prison	.
I	killed	two	people	.
One	was	my	girlfriend	,	and	the	other	was	the	man	I	'd	thought	was	my	best	friend	.
--------------------
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
Then	I	'm	forced	to	tell	you	the	rest	,	Lilli	.
I	...
I	lied	to	you	,	Lilli	!
I	told	you	I	'd	found	a	position	,	didn	't	I	?
Well	,	I	certainly	did	.
Do	you	know	where	?
In	a	counterfeiting	lab	.
That	's	one	place	that	can	use	an	engineer	who	's	an	ex-	con	.
--------------------
If	I	had	only	known	what	I	know	now	.
You	see	,	Lilli	?
This	time	you	don	't	say	,
"	Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.	"
Look	,	Tom	.
When	I	received	your	letter	,	did	you	really	think	me	so	dense	that	I	wouldn	't	sense	the	despair	in	your	heart	?
I	thought	to	myself	,
"	What	he	needs	is	to	regain	his	faith	in	himself	,	to	believe	that	everything	can	turn	out	well	again	.	"
And	I	thought	to	myself	,
--------------------
"	Maybe	you	can	restore	his	faith	in	himself	if	you	tell	him	how	much	you	care	for	him	and	that	you	will	stand	by	him	for	better	or	for	worse	.	"
And	so	I	came	to	you	.
Tell	me	,	have	you	taken	it	upon	yourself	to	rob	me	of	my	last	shred	of	sanity	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
You	!
You	!
You	have	to	report	that	he	's	failed	to	show	up	.
Let	's	wait	.
Finished	.
I	guess	I	have	no	other	choice	.
--------------------
Section	2-	B	?
Yes	.
This	is	Division	3	.
I	must	report	that	Kent	didn	't	show	up	.
Believe	me	,	Tom	,	your	life	is	just	beginning	.
A	brand-	new	life	,	clean	,	spotless	and	good	.
It	's	true	,	Tom	!
We	'll	put	it	all	behind	us	and	make	a	fresh	start	.
And	you	know	who	'll	help	us	?
Help	us	?
--------------------
Yes	,	Tom	.
The	man	who	once
When	he	had	to	arrest	you	,	he	was	so	decent	and	compassionate	towards	you	.
Lohmann	?
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Voberg	is	here	.
He	claims	to	have	some	important	news	.
Give	me	a	cigar	and	raise	the	shades	.
Then	show	him	in	.
--------------------
Morning	,	Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Well	,	Inspector	,	it	's	like	this	.
Scholz	and	I	think	we	've	stumbled	across	something
Lower	those	shades	.
Clumsy	fool	.
We	stumbled	across	something	that	might	lead	us	to	the	jewelry	robbers	.
Is	that	so	?
We	saw	a	girl	running	around	with	a	big	pearl	necklace	.
She	could	tell	me	anything	at	all	,	that	she	bought	the	thing	at	Woolworth	's	for	25	pfennigs	.
--------------------
But	Scholz	knows	about	these	things	,	and	he	swears	that	necklace	is	genuine	.
Well	,	is	it	?
So	far	all	we	know	is	that	she	's	the	sweetheart	of	a	scoundrel	who	's	an	expert	on	anything	having	to	do	with	jewelry	robberies	.
Where	are	the	others	?
They	had	a	few	details	to	take	care	of	.
Come	along	,	quietly	.
Come	along	,	Kent	.
Come	on	,	let	's	go	!
Off	you	go	,	then	,	but	remember	:
Be	careful	.
--------------------
You	're	dealing	with	a	dangerous	international	crook	.
Understand	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
All	right	then	.
Good	luck	.
Good	day	,	Chief	.
Let	the	woman	go	free	.
Do	with	me	what	you	like	,	but	let	her	go	free	.
You	monster	!
Tom	,	for	God	's	sake	!
--------------------
Stay	back	!
Good	God	!
What	's	that	?
Tom	,	what	's	that	?
What	's	that	,	Tom	?
Whatever	it	is	,	Lilli	,	we	must	find	it	and	put	an	end	to	it	.
He	won	't	be	able	to	do	it	anymore	.
What	do	you	mean	?
He	's	otherwise	engaged	.
Who	could	that	be	?
--------------------
How	do	I	know	?
Maybe	it	's	the	mailman	.
Anni	!
Wanna	go	and	see	who	that	is	?
Hold	on	.
Who	is	it	?
The	gas	man	.
I	'd	like	to	inspect	the	meter	.
Afternoon	,	miss	.
You	want	to	look	at	the	meter	?
--------------------
Come	back	some	other	time	.
I	've	got	company	right	now	.
How	dare	you	!
Police	.
Open	up	.
Look	out	!
Police	!
Don	't	shoot	!
Shut	up	,	you	idiot	!
Get	out	!
--------------------
Quick	,	out	the	back	door	!
We	don	't	have	one	!
You	idiots	get	an	apartment	with	only	one	exit	?
What	about	the	window	?
From	the	fourth	floor	?
There	must	be	some	way	out	!
Shall	I	put	in	an	elevator	for	you	guys	?
Now	we	're	really	done	for	!
That	guy	will	call	all	his	cop	friends	.
And	on	a	Sunday	,	too	.
--------------------
What	're	you	crying	about	?
It	's	your	own	damn	fault	for	firing	at	him	!
Leave	me	alone	,	you	hear	?
Stop	giving	me	a	hard	time	!
Listen	,	try	to	knock	a	hole	through	the	ceiling	.
Maybe	we	can	escape	to	the	roof	.
I	'll	try	to	hit	the	guy	and	keep	him	back	from	the	door	!
Stay	back	.
Notify	the	Special	Tactics	Squad	and	get	hold	of
Damned	scoundrel	!
--------------------
Who	should	I	get	hold	of	?
Homicide	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	'll	never	get	out	this	way	.
The	window	,	Tom	.
We	could	try	to	break	through	that	.
Cement	.
But	the	brick	,	maybe	.
Damn	it	!
--------------------
Hey	!
How	far	are	you	in	there	?
I	can	't	hold	this	door	forever	.
Lohmann	and	his	whole	gang	are	here	.
Lohmann	?
That	's	it	!
I	'm	out	!
Get	yourself	killed	,	all	of	you	!
What	do	you	mean	by	that	?
What	do	I	mean	?
--------------------
I	'll	tell	you	what	I	mean	!
Watch	the	door	!
Out	of	the	way	.
Hardy	,	be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	won	't	get	anywhere	on	the	roof	.
Let	me	talk	to	them	.
Let	me	tell	you	something	.
Anyone	who	gets	near	that	door	,	inside	or	out	,	is	gonna	get	it	,	understand	?
Go	keep	an	eye	on	them	!
--------------------
Move	it	!
Almost	.
Now	.
Let	's	see	now	.
What	's	the	matter	,	Tom	?
It	's	no	use	,	Lilli	.
Behind	those	bricks	is	a	steel	plate	.
Dear	God	!
Careful	!
A	bullet	can	cripple	you	for	life	!
--------------------
Is	he	dead	?
Karetzky	.
Goddamn	this	mess	!
Anni	,	get	some	towels	.
Come	on	,	quick	!
It	's	no	use	.
Better	keep	an	eye	on	the	door	.
Why	didn	't	you	let	me	negotiate	?
You	and	your	stupid	shooting	!
Bredow	,	shoot	anyone	who	comes	near	the	door	!
--------------------
Do	you	hear	?
You	bet	I	will	!
I	've	had	enough	of	this	business	.
I	've	got	you	now	.
Open	up	!
It	's	Lohmann	!
What	's	the	matter	?
Lohmann	's	outside	.
I	forbid	you	to	go	!
Who	are	you	to	forbid	anything	?
--------------------
I	won	't	land	in	jail	'cause	of	you	!
Think	I	'll	let	you	cowardly	swine	send	me	to	the	slaughter	?
Be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	've	got	hand	grenades	.
I	'll	give	you	one	last	chance	.
If	you	're	reasonable	,	we	'll	be	reasonable	too	.
That	's	the	way	.
Attaboy	.
Daddy	's	proud	of	you	.
--------------------
Now	,	open	the	door	and	put	your	hands	up	.
How	many	of	you	are	there	?
Five	,	Inspector	.
One	,	two	,	three	.
Diamond	Anna	!
See	you	don	't	catch	a	cold	,	my	dear	.
Four	.
Where	's	the	fifth	?
Damn	it	!
Don	't	try	anything	!
--------------------
A	Dreyse	pistol	.
What	do	you	know	?
A	Dreyse	pistol	,	no	less	.
Made	in	1906	,	7	.	65-	mm	.
Apparently	the	former	owner	-	a	friend	of	yours
No	.
No	?
That	's	funny	.
It	says	here	that	the	two	of	you	were	close	friends	.
It	's	signed	by	Karetzky	,	Diamond	Anna	,	and	her	sweetheart	.
--------------------
One	shouldn	't	forsake	a	friend	who	's	died	.
I	'm	not	forsaking	him	.
That	's	more	like	it	.
So	your	old	buddy	held	on	to	this	gun	because	he	was	used	to	it	.
Actually	,	haven	't	these	things	been	out	of	style	for	a	long	time	?
I	'm	no	gun	expert	.
That	's	right	.
You	're	more	of	an	expert	on	automobiles	.
What	make	of	car	did	Dr.	Kramm	drive	?
A	"	Hanomag	"	or	a	DKW	?
--------------------
Who	?
Dr.	Kramm	,	the	guy	you	two	rubbed	out	from	your	car	.
I	don	't	know	what	you	're	talking	about	,	Inspector	.
Is	that	so	?
Müiler	.
It	's	no	good	,	Lilli	.
I	can	't	find	a	thing	.
God	almighty	.
There	,	there	.
Steady	,	Lilli	.
--------------------
My	dear	little	Lilli	.
There	might	be	another	way	.
It	's	a	long	shot	.
What	if	we	flood	the	room	with	water	?
Water	?
Yes	.
Where	did	I
What	are	you	looking	for	,	Tom	?
My	knife	.
Water	lessens	the	force	of	an	explosion	.
--------------------
There	it	is	.
Out	of	the	way	.
It	just	might	break	through	the	wall	for	us	.
What	if	it	doesn	't	,	Tom	?
If	the	water	rises	,	and	we	're
Let	's	try	it	,	Tom	.
Here	you	are	,	Inspector	.
Thank	you	.
So	you	don	't	know	anything	about	Dr.	Kramm	's	murder	?
No	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
The	first	I	heard	of	it	was	right	here	.
Let	me	show	you	something	.
Come	here	.
Come	,	come	.
Take	a	look	at	this	still	life	.
You	're	familiar	with	this	here	.
A	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	made	in	1906	.
It	belonged	to	your	friend	.
He	shot	himself	with	it	,	didn	't	he	?
Yes	.
--------------------
Fine	.
But	do	you	know	what	's	in	there	?
No	.
Well	,	then	,	look	here	.
Take	that	magnifying	glass	and	take	a	careful	look	at	these	two	Easter	eggs	.
Well	?
See	any	difference	?
No	,	not	the	slightest	.
You	see	,	my	boy	,	that	's	just	it	!
None	of	us	police	could	detect	any	difference	either	,	neither	with	the	magnifying	glass	nor	in	the	photographs	.
--------------------
These	two	bullets	are	so	completely	identical	that	they	could	only	have	been	fired	from	the	same	gun	.
Yet	one	was	taken	from	the	skull	of	the	deceased	Dr.	Kramm	,	and	the	other	was	found	in	the	skull	of	your	dead	friend	Hardy	.
Glass	of	water	,	my	lad	?
Cigarette	.
So	now	tell	me	why	your	friend	Hardy	shot	and	killed	Dr.	Kramm	.
I	can	't	tell	you	that	,	Inspector	.
Liar	!
Kill	me	if	you	like	,	but	I	don	't	know	what	Hardy	's	orders	were	!
So	you	had	orders	?
Not	me	.
--------------------
Hardy	.
From	whom	?
I	couldn	't	tell	you	,	Inspector	.
I	've	never	seen	the	man	in	my	life	.
Now	enters	the	mystery	man	.
Come	on	in	and	pull	up	a	chair	.
Just	what	we	needed	:	the	man	in	the	shadows	.
So	you	don	't	know	the	man	's	name	?
On	my	honor	,	Inspector	,	I	don	't	know	who	gave	Hardy	those	orders	.
Then	there	's	nothing	we	can	do	.
--------------------
Dictate	for	the	record	what	you	know	about	the	whole	case	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Müiler	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
It	was	like	this	,	Mr.	Assistant	Inspector	.
I	was	just
I	was	just	washing	my	car	,	because	everything	has	to	be	in	top	shape	in	these	days	of	keen	competition	.
Suddenly	the	phone	rings	,	and	Hardy	picks	it	up	.
Then	he	came	and	said	we	were	to	catch	up	with	Dr.	Kramm	's	car	at	the	intersection	of	Körnerstrasse	and	Grüner	Winkel	.
So	we	set	out	,	of	course	,	and	pretty	soon	he	showed	up	.
--------------------
Sergeant	,	take	this	man	away	.
Isn	't	Professor	Baum	's	insane	asylum	on	Grüner	Winkel	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
So	that	's	where	Dr.	Kramm	spent	his	final	two	hours	.
Look	and	see	if	we	have	any	police	record	for	Dr.	Baum	.
Baum	-	Bertha	,	Anna	,	Ulrich	,	Max	.
Nothing	on	him	?
Well	,	that	was	-	Thank	you	.
Get	Professor	Baum	on	the	phone	for	me	.
Professor	,	it	's	police	headquarters	.
--------------------
Inspector	Lohmann	wishes	to	speak	to	you	.
This	is	Professor	Baum	.
This	man	swears	you	've	been	treating	him	for	the	last	two	months	.
I	think	he	's	just	trying	to	establish	an	alibi	.
I	'd	like	to	confront	him	with	you	.
Without	him	knowing	who	you	are	,	of	course	.
Could	you	come	over	right	away	?
Thanks	a	million	,	Professor	.
If	I	'm	on	the	right	track	now	,
I	'm	gonna	get	high	as	a	kite	tonight	!
--------------------
That	's	our	way	out	!
We	're	saved	!
Inspector	,	when	are	you	going	to	let	me	out	of	this	monkey	cage	?
My	dear	fellow	,	we	're	glad	we	've	got	you	in	there	.
But	I	've	told	you	everything	I	know	.
We	'll	see	about	that	.
Professor	,	please	.
Well	,	Professor	,	do	you	know	that	man	?
Is	he	the	one	?
No	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
I	've	definitely	never	seen	him	before	.
Just	as	I	thought	.
You	there	.
Then	I	've	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Professor	.
Sorry	to	disturb	you	,	Inspector	,	but	we	need	your	signature	here	.
I	'll	be	right	with	you	.
Pardon	me	a	moment	,	Professor	.
Perhaps	you	might	wait	in	my	office	.
Room	204	,	at	the	end	of	the	hall	.
--------------------
Thanks	.
Any	of	you	know	that	man	?
No	,	Inspector	.
No	.
Never	seen	him	before	.
Bredow	,	do	you	know	the	man	you	just	saw	with	me	?
No	,	Inspector	.
I	don	't	know	the	gentleman	.
Not	the	slightest	doubt	?
No	.
--------------------
MURDER	-	2,	000	MARKS	REWARD
Sad	business	,	isn	't	it	?
Especially	for	you	,	since	you	were	a	close	friend	of	the	victim	.
Yes	,	we	were	on	excellent	terms	as	colleagues	.
The	poor	fellow	even	visited	you	on	the	day	of	his	death	.
You	could	have	saved	us	a	lot	of	work	,	Professor	,	if	you	'd	reported	that	to	the	police	.
INFORMATlON	OF	ANY	KlND
ESPEClALLY	CONCERNlNG	THE	HOURS	FROM	6	:	00	TO	8	:	00	P.	M.
This	request	was	published	in	every	newspaper	and	posted	on	kiosks	all	over	the	city	.
I	never	read	newspapers	,	only	medical	literature	.
--------------------
And	today	's	the	first	time	I	've	been	in	town	in	four	weeks	.
Dr.	Kramm	came	to	look	something	up	in	a	scientific	book	in	my	library	.
He	left	in	the	best	of	spirits	.
As	for	his	death	,	it	's	as	much	a	mystery	to	me	as	it	is	to	you	.
Then	I	'm	terribly	sorry	to	have	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Why	,	it	's	Kent	!
Do	you	know	him	?
Who	?
Him	.
I	asked	you	if	you	knew	him	.
--------------------
Where	would	I	know	him	from	?
I	have	no	idea	,	yet	you	just	spoke	his	name	.
I	did	?
That	was	you	,	Inspector	.
Inspector	,	I	must	speak	to	you	.
It	's	terribly	urgent	.
I	suppose	I	may	leave	,	Inspector	?
My	time	is
Of	course	.
By	all	means	,	Professor	.
--------------------
Just	a	moment	,	Kent	.
Many	thanks	for	coming	.
Don	't	mention	it	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
Inspector	,	please	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
Go	on	in	.
It	's	all	right	.
It	's	tremendously	important	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
This	is	crucial	:
--------------------
Do	you	know	that	man	who	just	left	?
No	.
Are	you	certain	?
I	'm	certain	.
Yet	I	could	swear	he	knew	you	.
Most	certainly	not	.
I	've	never	seen	him	before	.
Damn	it	!
What	happened	to	you	,	for	God	's	sake	?
That	's	why	we	've	come	.
--------------------
And	what	is	the	name	of	this	"	boss	"	you	mention	?
Dr.	Mabuse	.
Goddamn	it	!
Mabuse	again	!
That	fellow	is	dead	!
He	's	alive	and	kicking	,	I	tell	you	.
I	saw	the	cadaver	myself	.
Bless	you	.
It	's	true	.
I	'm	telling	you	,	he	's	not	dead	.
--------------------
I	think	the	two	of	us	are	living	proof	of	that	,	though	as	for	"	living	,	"	that	was	pure	luck	!
Inspector	,	I	put	myself	completely	in	your	hands	.
Last	night	...
I	could	have	fled	but	I	didn	't	,	because	I	realized	this	is	about	more	than	my	life	or	liberty	.
My	God	,	how	can	I	convince	you	?
Is	this	proof	enough	for	you	?
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
Typewritten	.
That	's	no	proof	.
Someone	else	could	have
--------------------
"	Someone	else	"	?
I	'm	not	in	for	anybody	.
No	exceptions	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
All	the	evidence	leads	again	and	again	to	that	insane	asylum	.
Müiler	,	get	the	car	.
I	may	be	putting	my	neck	on	the	line	,	but	I	'm	going	out	there	once	more	,	and	you	're	going	with	me	,	Kent	.
Perhaps	you	're	right	and
Gentlemen	,	it	's	really	impossible	.
The	professor	gave	strict	orders	not	to	disturb	him	.
--------------------
My	good	man	,	I	must	speak	with	him	.
Now	go	on	and	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector	-	-	Will	you	announce	me	or	not	?
I	have	strict	instructions	-	-	Fine	.
Don	't	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector
That	's	him	!
That	's	his	voice	!
What	?
That	's	the	boss	's	voice	.
--------------------
I	'd	recognize	it	anywhere	.
That	's	the	man	!
Where	is	the	man	whose	voice	we	just	heard	?
Kent	,	come	over	here	.
What	is	it	?
That	's	his	voice	.
Nice	little	contraption	.
Very	clever	.
No	wonder	you	failed	to	recognize	the	man	's	voice	.
You	only	heard	a	mechanical	reproduction	of	it	.
--------------------
The	professor	?
Baum	.
Of	course	.
But	where	is	he	hiding	?
What	's	this	?
A	map	of	the	northern	part	of	town	?
That	must	be	the	Löhr	&	Stegerwald	chemical	factory	.
CHEMlCAL	PLANT	-	OCTOBER	15TH
And	today	's	date	.
Strange	.
--------------------
Very	strange	.
What	's	one	to	make	of	that	?
There	's	something	else	here	.
It	's	in	pencil	.
8	:	30	p	.	m	.	,	and	today	's	date	.
It	's	now	9	:	10	.
Kent	,	call	the	chemical	plant	.
There	won	't	be	anyone	there	,	but	they	must	have	guards	.
And	here	's	something	else	.
"	Notes	by	Dr.	Mabuse	"	?
--------------------
Isn	't	that	interesting	.
Go	ahead	.
Good	Lord	!
The	chemical	factory	!
"	Fires	started	in	this	manner	in	a	chemical	factory	's	storerooms	cannot	be	extinguished	by	firefighters	.
Tanks	exploding	from	the	heat	will	quickly	release	immense	quantities	of	poisonous	gas	into	surrounding	areas	of	the	city	.	"
Damn	it	!
They	're	playing	cards	again	instead	of	keeping	guard	.
Here	's	your	line	,	Inspector	.
Police	headquarters	?
--------------------
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Lohmann	,	look	!
What	?
In	the	light	there	!
Quiet	.
Over	there	!
Nothing	.
Damn	it	!
There	.
Krause	!
--------------------
Where	's	my	driver	?
Krause	!
Where	is	that	guy	?
Krause	!
I	'll	drive	,	Inspector	.
Push	that	car	out	of	the	way	.
I	just	hope	this	piece	of	junk	can	make	it	.
Faster	,	faster	!
Come	on	!

My	name	is	Mabuse	.

There	's	nothing	left	to	do	here	for	a	mere	police	inspector	.
Originally	124	minutes	long	,	the	film	had	been	banned	in	Germany	.
--------------------
It	wasn	't	until	August	24	,	1951	,	that	the	movie	was	first	shown	in	Germany	in	a	shortened	111	-	minute	version	.
The	original	negative	of	that	version	survived	at	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	but	was	severely	damaged	.
Therefore	,	a	1951	duplicate	positive	from	the	collection	of	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	served	as	a	basis	for	the	restoration	.
Whenever	possible	,	missing	scenes	from	the	Federal	Film	Archive	and	the	Munich	Film	Museum	were	inserted	.
In	its	present	form	,	the	film	runs	121	minutes	.
The	film	was	restored	by	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	in	collaboration	with	the	Federal	Film	Archive	,	the	Munich	Film	Museum	,
KirchMedia	and	ZDF/	ARTE	.

Those	are	the	girls	who	carry	dead	police	inspectors	directly	up	to	heaven	from	the	Alexanderplatz	with	a	"	Hey	ho	.	"
On	horseback	.
Horseback	?
Certainly	.
Expenses	don	't	allow	for	a	car	.
Well	,	Inspector	,	when	it	comes	to	corpses	,	the	state	sometimes	has	...	a	fit	of	generosity	.
That	's	what	you	think	.
Believe	it	or	not	,	Müiler	,	tonight	will	be	the	first	time
I	make	it	to	the	theater	in	time	for	the	first	act	.
--------------------
Knock	on	wood	,	Inspector	.
There	.
What	did	I	tell	you	?
Tell	'em	I	'm	dead	.
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Inspector	.
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Hofmeister	would	like	to	speak	with	you	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
What	?
Our	former	colleague	who	got	into	trouble	with	foreign	currency	?
That	scoundrel	?
Tell	him	his	call	is	the	most	shameless	affront
I	've	ever	experienced	!
And	tell	him	to	go	to	hell	!
I	'm	sorry	,	but	Inspector	Lohmann	has	already	left	and	he	says	you
And	he	says	you	can	go	to	hell	!
God	help	me	!
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	Müiler	.
--------------------
I	once	had	high	hopes	for	that	fellow	Hofmeister	.
I	gave	him	his	first	chance	.
And	what	does	the	scoundrel	do	?
He	takes	a	bribe	from	a	black-	market	currency	trader	.
Phooey	!
The	man	I	would	have	staked	my	life	for	disgraces	me	by	getting	fired	from	the	service

Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
He	has	to	hear	me	out	,	for	God	's	sake	!
--------------------
Tell	him	it	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	,	I	think	you	really	ought	to
Of	course	I	'll	miss	the	first	act	again	!
I	want	to	redeem	myself	in	his	eyes	!
I	finally	figured	out	their	scheme	.
It	's	a	monstrous	business	!
They	've	nearly	done	me	in	three	times	!
I	hardly	dare	cross	the	street	!
Lohmann	speaking	.
What	is	it	?
--------------------
Inspector	?
Thank	you	.
Cut	out	the	nonsense	and	tell	me	what	's	wrong	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
I	've	finally	discovered
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
Just	in	case	,	Inspector	,	please	have	a	record	made	of	my	report	.
Headphones	.
Take	this	down	.
I	was	actually	tracing	counterfeit	money	.
--------------------
I	wanted	to	redeem	myself	in	your	eyes	,	Inspector	.
For	four	days	-	96	hours
I	lay	up	there	at	the	air	vent	,	and	now	I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	.
But	you	'll	probably	think	I	'm	crazy	.
Who	is	it	?
I	swear	I	'm	telling	the	truth	.
I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	!
I	heard	his	name	with	my	own	ears	!
And	now	they	know	I	know	the	name	.
Can	you	trace	that	call	?
--------------------
For	God	's	sake	!
Hofmeister	!
What	street	?
Number	23	?
Thanks	.
Dear	God	.
He	must	have	gone	out	of	his	mind	from	terror	.
A	pathological	condition	that	is	not	as	rare	as	one	might	suspect	.
Exposure	to	catastrophes	such	as	explosions	,	earthquakes	and	railway	accidents	-	in	short	,	exposure	to	fright	and	horror	often	triggers	insanity	.
Perhaps	the	most	interesting	case	of	such	pathological	conditions	is	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	.
--------------------
Here	he	goes	again	.
I	shall	briefly	recount	the	history	of	this	case	.
The	patient	lived	a	decidedly	double	life	.
He	was	a	renowned	doctor	with	a	large	private	practice	.
Aided	by	an	almost	superhuman	logic	,	he	used	his	profound	knowledge	of	hypnosis	to	commit	crimes	of	a	magnitude	previously	deemed	impossible	.
For	months	the	police	sought	the	mastermind	behind	those	crimes	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	.
At	last	they	discovered	his	whereabouts	.
But	Mabuse	decided	not	to	flee	but	rather	to	mount	armed	resistance	,	and	he	barricaded	himself	in	his	house	with	four	loyal	henchmen	.
He	refused	demands	to	surrender	to	state	authorities	,	saying	,
"	I	am	the	state	!	"
--------------------
A	barrage	of	bullets	forced	the	police	to	retreat	.
Finally	,	soldiers	stormed	the	house	with	hand	grenades	.
Two	of	the	defenders	were	killed	.
Two	were	captured	.
Mabuse	,	however	,	had	disappeared	.
One	prisoner	revealed	his	hiding	place	:	a	counterfeiting	lab	from	which	he	planned	to	launch	a	massive	attack	on	the	German	currency	system	.
The	police	force	their	way	in	to	seize	him	only	to	find	he	had	gone	hopelessly	insane	.
Judging	by	his	incoherent	remarks	,	he	had	seen	,	during	the	previous	night	,	the	ghosts	of	all	those	he	had	slain	.
Apparently	it	was	the	horror	of	that	experience	that	overpowered	this	phenomenal	mind	,	which	for	so	long	had	straddled	the	fine	line	between	genius	and	madness	,	and	literally	deranged	it	.
Mabuse	was	committed	to	an	insane	asylum	and	to	this	day	has	not	spoken	a	word	to	anyone	.
--------------------
Silent	and	motionless	,	he	remains	in	the	position	you	see	here	.
The	patient	withdrew	into	his	own	ego	,	depriving	us	of	any	glimpse	into	his	inner	life	.
But	suddenly	the	clinical	profile	changed	.
We	observed	that	Mabuse	's	hand	continuously	made	writing	motions	in	the	air	,	on	the	wall	and	on	the	bedspread	.
We	gave	him	pencil	and	paper	.
At	first	,	he	covered	the	paper	with	senseless	scribbling	.
Two	years	ago	,	however	,	certain	words	began	to	appear	on	the	paper	.
Then	,	sentences	began	to	form	,	still	meaningless	and	confused	.
Gradually	they	grew	more	coherent	and	logical	,	and	at	last	we	began	to	get	glimpses	into	the	extraordinary	phenomenon	that	was	his	mind	.
His	thoughts	still	move	in	the	same	criminal	channels	as	before	.
--------------------
Whatever	Mabuse	writes	is	based	upon	incontrovertible	logic	and	serves	as	a	perfect	guide	for	the	commission	of	crimes	worked	out	to	the	minutest	detail	.
No	.
Nothing	can	happen	to	us	if	we	follow	the	doctor	's	methods	.
Oh	,	yeah	?
What	do	you	mean	,	"	oh	,	yeah	"	?
The	first	attacks	on	the	snitch	failed	.
So	what	?
Tough	luck	.
So	we	called	in	Division	2-	B	to	handle	the	matter	.
If	they	succeed	,	fine	.
--------------------
And	if	they	don	't	-	if	it	looks	like	that	snitch	might	rat	on	us	-	one	single	phone	call	and	this	whole	place	gets	blown	sky-	high	.
Stop	scratching	,	Fritzi	.
It	won	't	come	to	that	.
Before	that	guy	can	open	his	mouth	,	he	'll	be	done	for	.
I	'd	feel	better	if	they	didn	't	resort	to	murder	.
What	do	you	mean	,	murder	?
A	guy	can	have	something	fall	on	his	head	,	can	't	he	?
A	nice	,	clean	little	accident	.
I	don	't	care	how	you	make	it	look	.
I	just	don	't	want	anything	to	do	with	murder	.
--------------------
Scared	?
Can	't	bear	the	sight	of	blood	?
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	though	it	's	really	none	of	your	damn	business	.
I	've	killed	two	people	.
I	know	what	it	means	to	kill	.
And	that	's	precisely	why
I	want	nothing	to	do	with	murder	.
Leave	him	alone	,	Fritzi	.
What	do	you	know	about	Kent	?
The	phone	!
--------------------
Yeah	?
It	's	been	taken	care	of	?
Bravo	!
Really	?
Just	20	minutes	later	?
Lohmann	himself	?
Continue	writing	.
Hofmeister	himself	has	disappeared	.
The	rug	has	been	moved	toward	the	window	.
He	was	on	the	phone	when	the	lights	went	out	.
--------------------
Where	's	the	light	switch	?
Here	by	the	door	.
So	it	came	from	over	there	,	the	unknown	horror	,	the	thing	that	caused	his	mind	to	snap	.
And	he	backed	away	from	it	step	by	step	,	right	up	to	the	window	.
I	wonder	if	he
No	,	he	couldn	't	get	out	this	way	.
Certainly	not	downward	.
Well	,	I	'll	be	damned	!
Actual	letters	scratched	into	the	glass	with	a	ring	.
So	he	was	trying	to	tell	me	something	.
--------------------
Is	that	a	W	?
No	.
Could	it	be	a	name	?
It	may	take	us	a	while	to	figure	that	one	out	.
Hey	,	Krüger	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Take	this	pane	of	glass	to	my	office	at	headquarters	.
And	see	that	you	don	't	break	it	,	or	I	'll	bite	your	head	off	.
That	's	odd	.
I	wonder	what	's	behind	that	.
--------------------
Thirty	pages	today	,	Professor	.
Thank	you	.
Keep	a	careful	eye	on	him	tonight	.
I	don	't	like	his	pulse	.
In	any	case	,	give	him	a	shot	later	so	he	can	get	some	rest	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
Their	famous	chocolate	shake	?
And	a	double	mocha	for	you	,	sir	?
With	hot	cream	.
As	usual	.
--------------------
Very	well	.
And	now	tell	me	,	Tom	.
Why	did	you	ask	to	see	me	so	urgently	today	?
Don	't	you	know	what	today	is	,	Lilli	?
Today	?
Too	bad	.
Won	't	you	tell	me	?
Certainly	.
A	chocolate	shake	and	a	double	mocha	with	hot	cream	.
Well	,	Tom	?
--------------------
You	ask	what	day	this	is	?
Exactly	one	year	ago	today	,
No	smoking	,	gentlemen	.
Smoking	is	prohibited	.
Good	heavens	,	my	friend	,	are	you	back	again	?
I	've	told	you	a	hundred	times	there	's	no	point	in	coming	every	day	.
When	we	have	work	for	you	,	we	'll	certainly	notify	you	.
I	've	been	waiting	for	three	months	!
Be	reasonable	.
Reasonable	?
--------------------
What	does	reasonable	mean	when	a	man	is	going	under	?
I	want	to	work	!
But	they	keep	pushing	me	closer	to	the	edge	!
It	's	enough	to	drive	a	man	to	crime	!
He	's	forced	to	become	a	criminal	!
He	marches	in	here	and	causes	a	riot	!
Don	't	get	so	worked	up	.
We	have	others	to	attend	to	.
Come	now	.
Leave	him	alone	.
--------------------
He	's	sick	.
Come	now	.
Don	't	touch	me	!
I	'll	go	on	my	own	!
You	'll	never	see	me	again	here	!
Next	,	please	.
You	've	seen	the	last	of	me	!
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
I	can	't	bear	to	see	you	leave	like	this	.
Here	are	20	marks	.
--------------------
It	's	all	I	have	right	now	,	but	I	'd	like	you	to	have	it	.
It	may	help	you	out	.
I	don	't	want	charity	.
I	want	work	,	not	a	handout	.
It	's	not	a	handout	.
It	's	just	a	loan	.
I	'm	sure	you	'll	be	able	to	pay	me	back	.
Please	.
Yes	.
And	six	months	later	,	you	found	work	and	promptly	paid	back	my	20	marks	.
--------------------
Tell	me	,	Lilli	...
have	you	ever	been	in	love	?
It	's	high	time	I	was	going	.
Here	comes	my	bus	.
Please	stay	.
I	can	't	.
I	've	got	to	run	.
Good-	bye	,	Tom	.
Call	me	.
Good-	bye	.
--------------------
Good-	bye	.
If	you	'll	be	seated	,	Doctor	,	the	professor	is	due	back	any	moment	.
Thanks	,	Winkler	.
I	'm	sure	I	'll	find	what	I	need	.
Ah	,	I	see	it	's	on	his	desk	.
Oops	.
Oh	,	dear	!
What	order	does	all	this	go	in	?
This	junk	isn	't	even	numbered	.
What	is	this	anyway	?
--------------------
NOTES	BY	DR.	MABUSE	SEPTEMBER	1	ST	-	OCTOBER	31	ST
How	does	this	go	together	now	?
No	,	the	other	way	around	.
Then	this	page	.
What	's	the	next	part	?
"	Jewel	-	"
No	.
"	Jewel
ry	store	.	"
"	Jewelry	store	...	specializing	in	high-	quality	...	"
--------------------
What	?
"	The	least	conspicuous	and	therefore	most	effective	precaution	to	prevent	interruption	by	police	,	pedestrians	and	clients	is	to	pull	the	shades	and	hang	a	sign	on	the	door	:
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
Well	,	I	'll	be	!
"	The	criminals	then	lowered	the	shades	and	hung	a	sign	outside	the	door	,
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
If	that	isn	't	something	!
That	's	incredible	!
"	lmmobilize	the	staff	by	using	gas	in	bulbs	of	thin	glass	,	which	will	burst	almost	inaudibly	when	tossed	.	"
Gas	!
--------------------
Amazing	!
Identical	,	almost	to	the	word	!
"	The	criminals	appear	to	have	tossed	bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
"	Bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
If	that	isn	't	odd	!
It	's	as	if	they	were	following	a	blueprint	!
What	are	you	doing	there	?
Baum	.
This	is	the	most	incredible	thing	you	could	imagine	.
Look	here	.
--------------------
What	is	this	?
Where	did	you	get	these	papers	?
Never	mind	that	!
You	know	what	they	are	?
Yes	,	of	course	.
Now	read	this	.
"	Ingenious	jewelry	heist	...	"
That	's	right	.
Read	it	.
"	Jewelry	stolen	valued	at	250,	000	marks	.
--------------------
Gas	was	used	on	the	employees	.	"
Yes	,	just	as	if	they	were	following	your	Dr.	Mabuse	's	instructions	.
A	curious	coincidence	.
Now	wait	just	a	minute	.
You	call	that	a	coincidence	?
What	else	?
Baum	,	old	man	,	coincidences	like	that	just	don	't	happen	.
There	's	some	connection	in	all	this	or	I	'll	eat	my	hat	.
Say	,	I	've	got	a	crazy	idea	.
Could	this	Mabuse	fellow	be	faking	it	?
--------------------
Maybe	the	guy	isn	't	insane	after	all	.
Tell	me	,	do	you	think	that	,	after	treating	a	patient	for	years	,
I	can	't	judge	whether	he	's	really	sick	or	just	pretending	?
I	didn	't	mean	it	like	that	.
But	there	must	be	something	behind	all	this	.
You	know	what	a	genius	this	fellow	was	.
It	's	just	possible	that	his	dead	brain	has	come	back	to	life	.
Couldn	't	Mabuse	be	writing	these	things	as	a	sort	of	blueprint	for	a	gang	of	accomplices	?
You	've	always	had	a	wild	imagination	.
Just	hear	me	out	.
--------------------
What	if	Mabuse	,	with	his	incredible	hypnotic	powers	,	engaged	in	some	kind	of	telepathic	hypnosis	from	his	cell	?
Nonsense	!
Nonsense	?
Say	what	you	like	,	but	there	's	something	weird	going	on	!
Who	else	besides	you	knows	about	Mabuse	's	notes	?
You	sound	just	like	a	policeman	.
I	think	the	police	should	be	informed	of	this	strange	coincidence	.
The	police	?
Of	course	!
Well	,	perhaps
--------------------
Of	course	you	're	right	.
The	police	would	want	to	know	of	this	.
Of	course	!
I	'll	go	to	them	at	once	.
If	I	can	,	I	'll	call	you	from	the	station	.
Good-	bye	.
Please	drive	carefully	,	Doctor	.
It	's	been	raining	.
Thank	you	,	Winkler	.
Good-	bye	.

INGENlOUS	JEWELRY	HElST
STOLEN	JEWELRY	VALUED	AT	250,	000	MARKS
Almost	a	quarter	million	in	jewels	.
Pearls	,	platinum	,	gold	.
One	can	do	a	lot	with	that	.
Can	?
Could	!
But	what	will	be	done	with	it	?
What	's	gonna	happen	with	that	quarter	million	?
Careful	.
--------------------
I	ask	you
Will	you	stay	down	?
What	becomes	of	it	,	I	ask	you	?
We	buy	cocaine	with	it	,	morphine	,	heroin	,	opium	,	whatever	you	call	all	that	crap	.
And	instead	of	making	a	killing	off	the	dope	and	fleecing	the	types	who	are	crazy	for	the	stuff	,	they	practically	give	it	away	.
What	good	does	it	do	the	boss	to	pump	the	world	full	of	dope	and	not	make	any	money	off	it	?
These	things	won	't	stay	down	.
What	does	it	get	him	?
I	follow	his	instructions	and	drive	ten	people	nearly	crazy	with	threats	and	blackmail	.
And	when	they	're	ready	to	pay	any	sum	we	ask	,	then	I	'm	told	to	back	off	and	forget	about	the	money	.
--------------------
Only	result	is	they	're	driven	crazy	from	fear	of	a	scandal	.
Is	that	any	business	of	yours	,	old	boy	?
Did	you	ever	fail	to	get	your	pay	on	time	?
That	's	not	what	I	'm	saying	.
Okay	,	then	.
You	handle	the	blackmail	,	and	I	see	to	your	alibi	.
We	get	our	paychecks	like	clockwork	,	so	what	are	you	growling	about	?
I	'm	not	growling	.
I	just	don	't	get	it	.
If	a	woman	throws	herself	out	the	window	,	or	a	fellow	blows	his	brains	out	,	like	that	bank	director	,	blackmail	letters	aren	't	of	much	use	.
--------------------
150	grand	tossed	in	the	gutter	.
Is	there	any	sense	in	that	?
Or	take	the	new	instructions	about	the	explosives	,	and	stealing	poison	from	drugstores	-	that	's	scary	business	.
As	it	's	meant	to	be	,	my	dear	fellow	.
But	why	,	in	the	devil	's	name	?
I	think	you	ask	too	many	questions	.
The	boss	doesn	't	like	that	.
What	?
You	know	him	?
No	more	than	you	do	,	or	anyone	else	in	our	gang	.
--------------------
And	I	'm	not	the	least	bit	curious	.
I	learned	my	lesson	from	your	predecessor	.
He	just	had	to	find	out	what	the	man	looked	like	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	,	the	boss	.
So	one	day	,	without	having	been	summoned	,
Cut	it	out	,	man	.
You	're	spoiling	my	appetite	.
Let	me	give	you	a	tip	.
Let	the	boss	worry	about	this	stuff	.
We	're	well	paid	.
In	fact	,	very	well	paid	.
--------------------
If	something	goes	wrong	,	we	'll	have	cast-	iron	alibis	or	a	top-	notch	lawyer	.
The	boss	thinks	of	everything	and	takes	care	of	everything	and	demands	not	a	penny	for	himself	of	all	the	loot	.
Not	a	penny	.
See	?
That	's	just	it	.
Why	?
Why	doesn	't	he	take	a	single	penny	for	himself	?
I	can	't	understand	that	,	and	that	's	what	's	got	me	jumpy	.
Lots	of	others	in	our	gang	probably	feel	the	same	and	would	like	to	be	done	with	the	whole	thing	but	just	don	't	know	how	.
"	Dearest	Lilli	,	you	dashed	off	so	quickly	this	afternoon	that	I	had	no	chance	to	say	what	I	wanted	to	tell	you	.
--------------------
I	-	"
TONlGHT	AT	1	:	00	A.	M.	-	DR.	MABUSE
Inspector	Lohmann	asks	if	you	had	the	hospitals	searched	.
A	special	squad	did	that	,	and	Hofmeister	hasn	't	been	admitted	anywhere	?
Damn	it	!
You	'll	call	back	?
Wait	a	minute	.
Get	a	picture	of	Hofmeister	from	the	files	.
We	may	need	to	have	posters	printed	up	.
Now	,	then	,	what	is	your	assessment	of	the	murder	in	the	automobile	?
--------------------
So	far	,	all	I	know	is	that	the	killer	used	a	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	,	from	1906	,	production	of	which	ended	in	1916	.
This	weapon	was	fired	from	a	distance	of	not	more	than	25	feet	.
No	empty	shells	were	found	in	the	street	nor	on	the	sidewalk	,	and	the	bullet	's	trajectory	indicates	the	shot	was	not	fired	from	a	window	but	rather	from	a	point	almost	level	with	the	victim	's	head	.
We	may	therefore	conclude	the	shot	was	fired	from	another	vehicle	.
Another	vehicle	?
That	would	be	very	interesting	indeed	.
That	opens	up	a	whole	new	perspective	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Not	bad	.
Excuse	me	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
It	's	Habermann	.
This	is	about	the	Kramm	homicide	.
Inspector	,	we	've	traced	the	murder	victim	's	actions	up	until	6	:	10	on	the	evening	of	the	murder	.
Where	he	was	from	then	until	the	time	of	death	we	have	not	yet	been	able	to	establish	.
But	that	's	what	we	need	to	find	out	.
See	that	you	find	out	where	he	was	those	last	two	hours	.
Very	well	.
Müiler	,	arrange	to	have	-	No	,	wait	.
Where	's	the	text	for	the	Kramm	homicide	poster	?
Here	it	is	.
--------------------
"	All	information	will	be	kept	confidential	"
Put	another	line	in	here	:
"	Especially	concerning	the	hours	from	6	:	00	to	8	:	00	p	.	m	.	"
Have	those	changes	made	.
And	-	No	,	never	mind	.
I	'll	do	it	myself	.
Photo	department	.
Weber	,	the	old	man	wants	to	talk	to	you	.
Trouble	?
I	don	't	know	.

Weber	here	.
I	'm	just	doing	it	now	.
Enlargements	,	naturally	.
Trace	the	scratches	and	see	if	you	can	't	link	them	together	into	a	word	or	name	or	something	.
I	'm	sure	Hofmeister	intended	to
Inspector	,	they	found	Hofmeister	!
Where	?
The	police	station	at	Schöneberger	Ufer	.
A	police	patrol	found	him	.
At	first	they	thought	he	was	just	another	drunk	because	he	kept	babbling	to	himself	incessantly	.
--------------------
But	then	they	heard	him	call	your	name	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Why	won	't	you	listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	?
Inspector	,	you	must	listen	to	me	.
It	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	Lohmann	,	please	listen	,	for	the	love	of	God	!
My	God	!
You	see	?
The	moment	he	thinks	he	's	being	watched	,	he	starts	singing	.
When	he	thinks	he	's	alone	,	he	calls	your	name	.
--------------------
I	'll	leave	you	alone	now	.
Hofmeister	,	don	't	you	recognize	me	?
Goddamn	it	!
Hofmeister	,	it	's	me	,	Lohmann	.
Your	old	friend	Lohmann	.
My	God	!
Inspector	?
Inspector	Lohmann	?
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	?
For	God	's	sake	,	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	Lohmann	.
--------------------
Come	to	the	phone	!
Hello	.
This	is	Lohmann	.
Detective	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Who	is	it	,	please	?
Inspector	?
Is	that	you	,	Hofmeister	?
This	is	Lohmann	.
Hopeless	.
We	'll	have	no	other	choice	but	to	commit	the	poor	devil	to	an	institution	.
--------------------
Listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	?
Poor	devil	,	eh	?
Heaven	help	me	if	I	ever	get	my	hands	on	the	scoundrel	responsible	for	that	fellow	's	condition	!
All	of	a	sudden	he	stopped	writing	and	just	sat	there	like	a	living	corpse	.
Then	he	suddenly	got	an	expression	in	his	eyes	,
If	he	were	in	his	right	mind	,
I	believe	he	could	compel	people	to	do	his	will	right	from	his	cell	.
The	professor	must	come	.
The	professor	is	working	and	doesn	't	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
--------------------
Winkler	,	this	is	Mabuse	!
Not	so	loud	!
The	professor	will	fire	me	on	the	spot	.

Murder	.
No	!
It	's	really	none	of	my	business	,	but	I	don	't	think	you	're	taking	the	doctor	's	warning	seriously	enough	.
Oh	,	yes	,	I	am	.
Division	2-	B.
No	one	in	the	organization	gets	out	of	it	alive	.

But	there	's	no	other	way	for	me	to	behave	decently	towards	you	.
You	will	never	know	what	you	've	meant	in	my	botched	life	.
It	is	very	difficult	to	say	good-	bye	to	you	,	Lilli	.	"
"	Forget	me	-	though	I	shall	never	forget	you	!	"
It	spells	Mabuse	.
What	spells	Mabuse	?
Those	scratches	on	the	windowpane	,	Inspector	.
It	took	me	forever	to	discover	he	was	writing	as	if	in	a	mirror	.
--------------------
Using	his	left	hand	,	and	behind	his	back	.
If	you	flip	it	over	,	see	there	?

Quite	right	.

Let	's	see	what	business	he	has	being	on	that	windowpane	.
then	you	may	sweep	up	as	much	as	you	like	.
But	until	then	,	he	'll	go	wild	as	an	ape	if	you	touch	anything	,	and	he	bites	.
I	'd	like	to	see	him	try	.
The	old	man	's	coming	.
Get	out	!
Müiler	,	come	here	.
Call	up	G9-	19-	902	.
That	's	the	mental	hospital	run	by	Professor	Baum	where	they	committed	a	certain	Dr.	Mabuse	.
I	'd	like	to	know	if	he	's	still	there	.
--------------------
When	?
Thank	you	.
Dr.	Mabuse	died	this	morning	.
This	morning	?
Today	of	all	days	.
That	is	quite	peculiar	.
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
So	,	you	too	?
What	do	you	mean	,	me	too	?
Something	big	is	on	for	tonight	,	it	seems	.
--------------------
We	've	been	called	in	,	as	have	Divisions	5	and	9	...	as	well	as	Section	2-	B.
Good	Lord	.
It	's	no	use	,	Kent	.
The	doctor	is	more	powerful	than	you	.
Is	your	curiosity	satisfied	now	,
Inspector	?
And	this	corpse	is	clearly	identified	as	Mabuse	?
There	's	no	doubt	of	that	?
Unfortunately	not	,	Inspector	.
Unfortunately	it	is	only	too	certain	that	this	dead	man	here	is	Dr.	Mabuse	.
--------------------
Or	was	.
Alas	.
This	assessment	of	the	deceased
Is	smoking	permitted	here	?
Yes	.
seems	to	me	to	be	slightly	,	let	's	say
Do	you	smoke	?
No	,	thanks	.
let	's	say	slightly	exaggerated	.
In	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	,	we	're	not	dealing	with	a	human	being	of	value	but	with	an	evil	criminal	who	only	escaped	the	gallows	by	entering	an	insane	asylum	.
--------------------
One	less	insane	criminal	in	the	world	.
Silence	!
You	have	no	idea	.
No	one	has	any	idea	what	kind	of	phenomenal	,	superhuman	mind	has	come	to	an	end	with	Dr.	Mabuse	's	death	.
This	mind	would	have	laid	waste	to	our	whole	rotten	world	,	which	is	long	overdue	for	destruction	.
This	godless	world	,	devoid	of	justice	and	compassion	,	consisting	only	of	selfishness	,	cruelty	and	hatred	.
This	mind	would	have	destroyed	mankind	,	which	itself	knows	only	destruction	and	extermination	and	which	could	only	have	been	saved	in	its	final	hour	through	terror	and	horror	.
Mabuse	the	criminal	?
Mabuse	the	genius	!
His	intellectual	legacy	would	have	turned	your	world	,	with	its	police	protection	,	on	its	head	!
--------------------
His	legacy	?
You	speak	of	Mabuse	's	legacy	?
No	.
Yes	.
Of	course	,	not	a	testament	in	the	accepted	sense	of	the	word	.
Just	some	of	his	notes	,	of	interest	only	to	physicians	and	men	of	science	.
I	'm	afraid	,	Professor	,	that	you	underestimate	the	number	of	subjects	in	which	I	take	an	interest	.
Take	,	for	example	,	a	case	which	concerns	me	intimately	.
Wasn	't	a	young	man	admitted	to	your	institution	earlier	today	by	the	name	of	Hofmeister	?
May	I	see	that	man	?
--------------------
I	'm	terribly	sorry	,	Inspector	.
That	man	seems	to	be	suffering	the	effects	of	some	frightful	experience	that	he	relives	each	time	someone	approaches	him	.
Then	he	begins	singing	like	a	frightened	child	sings	in	the	dark	.
I	must	therefore	request	,	for	the	good	of	the	patient	,	that	you	refrain	from	seeing	him	now	.
What	is	it	?
Forgive	me	,	Professor	.
We	only	wanted	to
They	're	waiting	for	you	in	anatomy	class	.
Yes	,	of	course	.
Well	,	I	see	the	doctor	's	cell	is	already	occupied	again	.
--------------------
Yes	,	the	new	one	who	arrived	last	night	.
The	professor	ordered	that	he	be	isolated	.
The	doctor	's	cell	just	became	vacant	,	so	we	put	him	in	it	.
It	's	strange	when	you	come	to	think	of	it	.
For	10	years	I	've	cared	for	the	doctor	,	and	now	he	lies	down	there	in	the	morgue	.
Or	what	's	left	of	him	.

But	you	don	't	even	know	who	I	am	,	Lilli	.
My	dear	Tom	,	isn	't	that	entirely	beside	the	point	?
Beside	the	point	?
Entirely	beside	the	point	!
We	'll	see	right	now	whether	it	's	beside	the	point	!
There	you	have	it	,	in	black	and	white	-	just	who	I	am	.
Official	confirmation	with	the	seal	and	signature	of	the	prison	director	and	everything	that	goes	with	it	.
Prison	.
Yes	,	prison	!
Four	and	a	half	years	in	prison	!
--------------------
The	last	six	months	commuted	for	good	behavior	.
There	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
You	don	't	know	why	I	was	in	prison	.
I	killed	two	people	.
One	was	my	girlfriend	,	and	the	other	was	the	man	I	'd	thought	was	my	best	friend	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
Then	I	'm	forced	to	tell	you	the	rest	,	Lilli	.
--------------------
I	...
I	lied	to	you	,	Lilli	!
I	told	you	I	'd	found	a	position	,	didn	't	I	?
Well	,	I	certainly	did	.
Do	you	know	where	?
In	a	counterfeiting	lab	.
That	's	one	place	that	can	use	an	engineer	who	's	an	ex-	con	.
If	I	had	only	known	what	I	know	now	.
You	see	,	Lilli	?
This	time	you	don	't	say	,
--------------------
"	Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.	"
Look	,	Tom	.
When	I	received	your	letter	,	did	you	really	think	me	so	dense	that	I	wouldn	't	sense	the	despair	in	your	heart	?
I	thought	to	myself	,
"	What	he	needs	is	to	regain	his	faith	in	himself	,	to	believe	that	everything	can	turn	out	well	again	.	"
And	I	thought	to	myself	,
"	Maybe	you	can	restore	his	faith	in	himself	if	you	tell	him	how	much	you	care	for	him	and	that	you	will	stand	by	him	for	better	or	for	worse	.	"
And	so	I	came	to	you	.
Tell	me	,	have	you	taken	it	upon	yourself	to	rob	me	of	my	last	shred	of	sanity	?
--------------------
Yes	,	Tom	.
You	!
You	!
You	have	to	report	that	he	's	failed	to	show	up	.
Let	's	wait	.
Finished	.
I	guess	I	have	no	other	choice	.
Section	2-	B	?
Yes	.
This	is	Division	3	.
--------------------
I	must	report	that	Kent	didn	't	show	up	.
Believe	me	,	Tom	,	your	life	is	just	beginning	.
A	brand-	new	life	,	clean	,	spotless	and	good	.
It	's	true	,	Tom	!
We	'll	put	it	all	behind	us	and	make	a	fresh	start	.
And	you	know	who	'll	help	us	?
Help	us	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
The	man	who	once
When	he	had	to	arrest	you	,	he	was	so	decent	and	compassionate	towards	you	.
--------------------
Lohmann	?
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Voberg	is	here	.
He	claims	to	have	some	important	news	.
Give	me	a	cigar	and	raise	the	shades	.
Then	show	him	in	.
Morning	,	Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Well	,	Inspector	,	it	's	like	this	.
--------------------
Scholz	and	I	think	we	've	stumbled	across	something
Lower	those	shades	.
Clumsy	fool	.
We	stumbled	across	something	that	might	lead	us	to	the	jewelry	robbers	.
Is	that	so	?
We	saw	a	girl	running	around	with	a	big	pearl	necklace	.
She	could	tell	me	anything	at	all	,	that	she	bought	the	thing	at	Woolworth	's	for	25	pfennigs	.
But	Scholz	knows	about	these	things	,	and	he	swears	that	necklace	is	genuine	.
Well	,	is	it	?
So	far	all	we	know	is	that	she	's	the	sweetheart	of	a	scoundrel	who	's	an	expert	on	anything	having	to	do	with	jewelry	robberies	.
--------------------
Where	are	the	others	?
They	had	a	few	details	to	take	care	of	.
Come	along	,	quietly	.
Come	along	,	Kent	.
Come	on	,	let	's	go	!
Off	you	go	,	then	,	but	remember	:
Be	careful	.
You	're	dealing	with	a	dangerous	international	crook	.
Understand	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
All	right	then	.
Good	luck	.
Good	day	,	Chief	.
Let	the	woman	go	free	.
Do	with	me	what	you	like	,	but	let	her	go	free	.
You	monster	!
Tom	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Stay	back	!
Good	God	!
What	's	that	?
--------------------
Tom	,	what	's	that	?
What	's	that	,	Tom	?
Whatever	it	is	,	Lilli	,	we	must	find	it	and	put	an	end	to	it	.
He	won	't	be	able	to	do	it	anymore	.
What	do	you	mean	?
He	's	otherwise	engaged	.
Who	could	that	be	?
How	do	I	know	?
Maybe	it	's	the	mailman	.
Anni	!
--------------------
Wanna	go	and	see	who	that	is	?
Hold	on	.
Who	is	it	?
The	gas	man	.
I	'd	like	to	inspect	the	meter	.
Afternoon	,	miss	.
You	want	to	look	at	the	meter	?
Come	back	some	other	time	.
I	've	got	company	right	now	.
How	dare	you	!
--------------------
Police	.
Open	up	.
Look	out	!
Police	!
Don	't	shoot	!
Shut	up	,	you	idiot	!
Get	out	!
Quick	,	out	the	back	door	!
We	don	't	have	one	!
You	idiots	get	an	apartment	with	only	one	exit	?
--------------------
What	about	the	window	?
From	the	fourth	floor	?
There	must	be	some	way	out	!
Shall	I	put	in	an	elevator	for	you	guys	?
Now	we	're	really	done	for	!
That	guy	will	call	all	his	cop	friends	.
And	on	a	Sunday	,	too	.
What	're	you	crying	about	?
It	's	your	own	damn	fault	for	firing	at	him	!
Leave	me	alone	,	you	hear	?
--------------------
Stop	giving	me	a	hard	time	!
Listen	,	try	to	knock	a	hole	through	the	ceiling	.
Maybe	we	can	escape	to	the	roof	.
I	'll	try	to	hit	the	guy	and	keep	him	back	from	the	door	!
Stay	back	.
Notify	the	Special	Tactics	Squad	and	get	hold	of
Damned	scoundrel	!
Who	should	I	get	hold	of	?
Homicide	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
--------------------
It	's	no	use	.
We	'll	never	get	out	this	way	.
The	window	,	Tom	.
We	could	try	to	break	through	that	.
Cement	.
But	the	brick	,	maybe	.
Damn	it	!
Hey	!
How	far	are	you	in	there	?
I	can	't	hold	this	door	forever	.
--------------------
Lohmann	and	his	whole	gang	are	here	.
Lohmann	?
That	's	it	!
I	'm	out	!
Get	yourself	killed	,	all	of	you	!
What	do	you	mean	by	that	?
What	do	I	mean	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	I	mean	!
Watch	the	door	!
Out	of	the	way	.
--------------------
Hardy	,	be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	won	't	get	anywhere	on	the	roof	.
Let	me	talk	to	them	.
Let	me	tell	you	something	.
Anyone	who	gets	near	that	door	,	inside	or	out	,	is	gonna	get	it	,	understand	?
Go	keep	an	eye	on	them	!
Move	it	!
Almost	.
Now	.
--------------------
Let	's	see	now	.
What	's	the	matter	,	Tom	?
It	's	no	use	,	Lilli	.
Behind	those	bricks	is	a	steel	plate	.
Dear	God	!
Careful	!
A	bullet	can	cripple	you	for	life	!
Is	he	dead	?
Karetzky	.
Goddamn	this	mess	!
--------------------
Anni	,	get	some	towels	.
Come	on	,	quick	!
It	's	no	use	.
Better	keep	an	eye	on	the	door	.
Why	didn	't	you	let	me	negotiate	?
You	and	your	stupid	shooting	!
Bredow	,	shoot	anyone	who	comes	near	the	door	!
Do	you	hear	?
You	bet	I	will	!
I	've	had	enough	of	this	business	.
--------------------
I	've	got	you	now	.
Open	up	!
It	's	Lohmann	!
What	's	the	matter	?
Lohmann	's	outside	.
I	forbid	you	to	go	!
Who	are	you	to	forbid	anything	?
I	won	't	land	in	jail	'cause	of	you	!
Think	I	'll	let	you	cowardly	swine	send	me	to	the	slaughter	?
Be	sensible	.
--------------------
It	's	no	use	.
We	've	got	hand	grenades	.
I	'll	give	you	one	last	chance	.
If	you	're	reasonable	,	we	'll	be	reasonable	too	.
That	's	the	way	.
Attaboy	.
Daddy	's	proud	of	you	.
Now	,	open	the	door	and	put	your	hands	up	.
How	many	of	you	are	there	?
Five	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
One	,	two	,	three	.
Diamond	Anna	!
See	you	don	't	catch	a	cold	,	my	dear	.
Four	.
Where	's	the	fifth	?
Damn	it	!
Don	't	try	anything	!
A	Dreyse	pistol	.
What	do	you	know	?
A	Dreyse	pistol	,	no	less	.
--------------------
Made	in	1906	,	7	.	65-	mm	.
Apparently	the	former	owner	-	a	friend	of	yours
No	.
No	?
That	's	funny	.
It	says	here	that	the	two	of	you	were	close	friends	.
It	's	signed	by	Karetzky	,	Diamond	Anna	,	and	her	sweetheart	.
One	shouldn	't	forsake	a	friend	who	's	died	.
I	'm	not	forsaking	him	.
That	's	more	like	it	.
--------------------
So	your	old	buddy	held	on	to	this	gun	because	he	was	used	to	it	.
Actually	,	haven	't	these	things	been	out	of	style	for	a	long	time	?
I	'm	no	gun	expert	.
That	's	right	.
You	're	more	of	an	expert	on	automobiles	.
What	make	of	car	did	Dr.	Kramm	drive	?
A	"	Hanomag	"	or	a	DKW	?
Who	?
Dr.	Kramm	,	the	guy	you	two	rubbed	out	from	your	car	.
I	don	't	know	what	you	're	talking	about	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
Is	that	so	?
Müiler	.
It	's	no	good	,	Lilli	.
I	can	't	find	a	thing	.
God	almighty	.
There	,	there	.
Steady	,	Lilli	.
My	dear	little	Lilli	.
There	might	be	another	way	.
It	's	a	long	shot	.
--------------------
What	if	we	flood	the	room	with	water	?
Water	?
Yes	.
Where	did	I
What	are	you	looking	for	,	Tom	?
My	knife	.
Water	lessens	the	force	of	an	explosion	.
There	it	is	.
Out	of	the	way	.
It	just	might	break	through	the	wall	for	us	.
--------------------
What	if	it	doesn	't	,	Tom	?
If	the	water	rises	,	and	we	're
Let	's	try	it	,	Tom	.
Here	you	are	,	Inspector	.
Thank	you	.
So	you	don	't	know	anything	about	Dr.	Kramm	's	murder	?
No	,	Inspector	.
The	first	I	heard	of	it	was	right	here	.
Let	me	show	you	something	.
Come	here	.
--------------------
Come	,	come	.
Take	a	look	at	this	still	life	.
You	're	familiar	with	this	here	.
A	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	made	in	1906	.
It	belonged	to	your	friend	.
He	shot	himself	with	it	,	didn	't	he	?
Yes	.
Fine	.
But	do	you	know	what	's	in	there	?
No	.
--------------------
Well	,	then	,	look	here	.
Take	that	magnifying	glass	and	take	a	careful	look	at	these	two	Easter	eggs	.
Well	?
See	any	difference	?
No	,	not	the	slightest	.
You	see	,	my	boy	,	that	's	just	it	!
None	of	us	police	could	detect	any	difference	either	,	neither	with	the	magnifying	glass	nor	in	the	photographs	.
These	two	bullets	are	so	completely	identical	that	they	could	only	have	been	fired	from	the	same	gun	.
Yet	one	was	taken	from	the	skull	of	the	deceased	Dr.	Kramm	,	and	the	other	was	found	in	the	skull	of	your	dead	friend	Hardy	.
Glass	of	water	,	my	lad	?
--------------------
Cigarette	.
So	now	tell	me	why	your	friend	Hardy	shot	and	killed	Dr.	Kramm	.
I	can	't	tell	you	that	,	Inspector	.
Liar	!
Kill	me	if	you	like	,	but	I	don	't	know	what	Hardy	's	orders	were	!
So	you	had	orders	?
Not	me	.
Hardy	.
From	whom	?
I	couldn	't	tell	you	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
I	've	never	seen	the	man	in	my	life	.
Now	enters	the	mystery	man	.
Come	on	in	and	pull	up	a	chair	.
Just	what	we	needed	:	the	man	in	the	shadows	.
So	you	don	't	know	the	man	's	name	?
On	my	honor	,	Inspector	,	I	don	't	know	who	gave	Hardy	those	orders	.
Then	there	's	nothing	we	can	do	.
Dictate	for	the	record	what	you	know	about	the	whole	case	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Müiler	.
--------------------
Yes	,	Inspector	.
It	was	like	this	,	Mr.	Assistant	Inspector	.
I	was	just
I	was	just	washing	my	car	,	because	everything	has	to	be	in	top	shape	in	these	days	of	keen	competition	.
Suddenly	the	phone	rings	,	and	Hardy	picks	it	up	.
Then	he	came	and	said	we	were	to	catch	up	with	Dr.	Kramm	's	car	at	the	intersection	of	Körnerstrasse	and	Grüner	Winkel	.
So	we	set	out	,	of	course	,	and	pretty	soon	he	showed	up	.
Sergeant	,	take	this	man	away	.
Isn	't	Professor	Baum	's	insane	asylum	on	Grüner	Winkel	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
So	that	's	where	Dr.	Kramm	spent	his	final	two	hours	.
Look	and	see	if	we	have	any	police	record	for	Dr.	Baum	.
Baum	-	Bertha	,	Anna	,	Ulrich	,	Max	.
Nothing	on	him	?
Well	,	that	was	-	Thank	you	.
Get	Professor	Baum	on	the	phone	for	me	.
Professor	,	it	's	police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	wishes	to	speak	to	you	.
This	is	Professor	Baum	.
This	man	swears	you	've	been	treating	him	for	the	last	two	months	.
--------------------
I	think	he	's	just	trying	to	establish	an	alibi	.
I	'd	like	to	confront	him	with	you	.
Without	him	knowing	who	you	are	,	of	course	.
Could	you	come	over	right	away	?
Thanks	a	million	,	Professor	.
If	I	'm	on	the	right	track	now	,
I	'm	gonna	get	high	as	a	kite	tonight	!
That	's	our	way	out	!
We	're	saved	!
Inspector	,	when	are	you	going	to	let	me	out	of	this	monkey	cage	?
--------------------
My	dear	fellow	,	we	're	glad	we	've	got	you	in	there	.
But	I	've	told	you	everything	I	know	.
We	'll	see	about	that	.
Professor	,	please	.
Well	,	Professor	,	do	you	know	that	man	?
Is	he	the	one	?
No	,	Inspector	.
I	've	definitely	never	seen	him	before	.
Just	as	I	thought	.
You	there	.
--------------------
Then	I	've	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Professor	.
Sorry	to	disturb	you	,	Inspector	,	but	we	need	your	signature	here	.
I	'll	be	right	with	you	.
Pardon	me	a	moment	,	Professor	.
Perhaps	you	might	wait	in	my	office	.
Room	204	,	at	the	end	of	the	hall	.
Thanks	.
Any	of	you	know	that	man	?
No	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
No	.
Never	seen	him	before	.
Bredow	,	do	you	know	the	man	you	just	saw	with	me	?
No	,	Inspector	.
I	don	't	know	the	gentleman	.
Not	the	slightest	doubt	?
No	.
MURDER	-	2,	000	MARKS	REWARD
Sad	business	,	isn	't	it	?
Especially	for	you	,	since	you	were	a	close	friend	of	the	victim	.
--------------------
Yes	,	we	were	on	excellent	terms	as	colleagues	.
The	poor	fellow	even	visited	you	on	the	day	of	his	death	.
You	could	have	saved	us	a	lot	of	work	,	Professor	,	if	you	'd	reported	that	to	the	police	.
INFORMATlON	OF	ANY	KlND
ESPEClALLY	CONCERNlNG	THE	HOURS	FROM	6	:	00	TO	8	:	00	P.	M.
This	request	was	published	in	every	newspaper	and	posted	on	kiosks	all	over	the	city	.
I	never	read	newspapers	,	only	medical	literature	.
And	today	's	the	first	time	I	've	been	in	town	in	four	weeks	.
Dr.	Kramm	came	to	look	something	up	in	a	scientific	book	in	my	library	.
He	left	in	the	best	of	spirits	.
--------------------
As	for	his	death	,	it	's	as	much	a	mystery	to	me	as	it	is	to	you	.
Then	I	'm	terribly	sorry	to	have	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Why	,	it	's	Kent	!
Do	you	know	him	?
Who	?
Him	.
I	asked	you	if	you	knew	him	.
Where	would	I	know	him	from	?
I	have	no	idea	,	yet	you	just	spoke	his	name	.
I	did	?
--------------------
That	was	you	,	Inspector	.
Inspector	,	I	must	speak	to	you	.
It	's	terribly	urgent	.
I	suppose	I	may	leave	,	Inspector	?
My	time	is
Of	course	.
By	all	means	,	Professor	.
Just	a	moment	,	Kent	.
Many	thanks	for	coming	.
Don	't	mention	it	.
--------------------
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
Inspector	,	please	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
Go	on	in	.
It	's	all	right	.
It	's	tremendously	important	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
This	is	crucial	:
Do	you	know	that	man	who	just	left	?
No	.
Are	you	certain	?
--------------------
I	'm	certain	.
Yet	I	could	swear	he	knew	you	.
Most	certainly	not	.
I	've	never	seen	him	before	.
Damn	it	!
What	happened	to	you	,	for	God	's	sake	?
That	's	why	we	've	come	.
And	what	is	the	name	of	this	"	boss	"	you	mention	?
Dr.	Mabuse	.
Goddamn	it	!
--------------------
Mabuse	again	!
That	fellow	is	dead	!
He	's	alive	and	kicking	,	I	tell	you	.
I	saw	the	cadaver	myself	.
Bless	you	.
It	's	true	.
I	'm	telling	you	,	he	's	not	dead	.
I	think	the	two	of	us	are	living	proof	of	that	,	though	as	for	"	living	,	"	that	was	pure	luck	!
Inspector	,	I	put	myself	completely	in	your	hands	.
Last	night	...
--------------------
I	could	have	fled	but	I	didn	't	,	because	I	realized	this	is	about	more	than	my	life	or	liberty	.
My	God	,	how	can	I	convince	you	?
Is	this	proof	enough	for	you	?
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
Typewritten	.
That	's	no	proof	.
Someone	else	could	have
"	Someone	else	"	?
I	'm	not	in	for	anybody	.
No	exceptions	.
--------------------
Yes	,	Professor	.
All	the	evidence	leads	again	and	again	to	that	insane	asylum	.
Müiler	,	get	the	car	.
I	may	be	putting	my	neck	on	the	line	,	but	I	'm	going	out	there	once	more	,	and	you	're	going	with	me	,	Kent	.
Perhaps	you	're	right	and
Gentlemen	,	it	's	really	impossible	.
The	professor	gave	strict	orders	not	to	disturb	him	.
My	good	man	,	I	must	speak	with	him	.
Now	go	on	and	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector	-	-	Will	you	announce	me	or	not	?
--------------------
I	have	strict	instructions	-	-	Fine	.
Don	't	announce	me	.
But	,	Inspector
That	's	him	!
That	's	his	voice	!
What	?
That	's	the	boss	's	voice	.
I	'd	recognize	it	anywhere	.
That	's	the	man	!
Where	is	the	man	whose	voice	we	just	heard	?
--------------------
Kent	,	come	over	here	.
What	is	it	?
That	's	his	voice	.
Nice	little	contraption	.
Very	clever	.
No	wonder	you	failed	to	recognize	the	man	's	voice	.
You	only	heard	a	mechanical	reproduction	of	it	.
The	professor	?
Baum	.
Of	course	.
--------------------
But	where	is	he	hiding	?
What	's	this	?
A	map	of	the	northern	part	of	town	?
That	must	be	the	Löhr	&	Stegerwald	chemical	factory	.
CHEMlCAL	PLANT	-	OCTOBER	15TH
And	today	's	date	.
Strange	.
Very	strange	.
What	's	one	to	make	of	that	?
There	's	something	else	here	.

Kent	,	call	the	chemical	plant	.
There	won	't	be	anyone	there	,	but	they	must	have	guards	.
And	here	's	something	else	.

Go	ahead	.
Good	Lord	!

The	chemical	factory	!
"	Fires	started	in	this	manner	in	a	chemical	factory	's	storerooms	cannot	be	extinguished	by	firefighters	.
Tanks	exploding	from	the	heat	will	quickly	release	immense	quantities	of	poisonous	gas	into	surrounding	areas	of	the	city	.	"
Damn	it	!
They	're	playing	cards	again	instead	of	keeping	guard	.
Here	's	your	line	,	Inspector	.
Police	headquarters	?
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Lohmann	,	look	!
What	?
--------------------
In	the	light	there	!
Quiet	.
Over	there	!
Nothing	.
Damn	it	!
There	.
Krause	!
Where	's	my	driver	?
Krause	!
Where	is	that	guy	?
--------------------
Krause	!
I	'll	drive	,	Inspector	.
Push	that	car	out	of	the	way	.
I	just	hope	this	piece	of	junk	can	make	it	.
Faster	,	faster	!
Come	on	!
CAUTlON	-	RAlLROAD	CROSSlNG
Get	out	of	the	way	!
Faster	!
Come	on	!
--------------------
Now	we	're	done	for	.
Get	the	spare	.
Permit	me	to	introduce	myself	.
My	name	is	Mabuse	.
Dr.	Mabuse	.

Who	opened	that	door	?
Run	and	get	help	!

Come	,	my	boy	.
There	's	nothing	left	to	do	here	for	a	mere	police	inspector	.
Originally	124	minutes	long	,	the	film	had	been	banned	in	Germany	.
It	wasn	't	until	August	24	,	1951	,	that	the	movie	was	first	shown	in	Germany	in	a	shortened	111	-	minute	version	.
The	original	negative	of	that	version	survived	at	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	but	was	severely	damaged	.
Therefore	,	a	1951	duplicate	positive	from	the	collection	of	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	served	as	a	basis	for	the	restoration	.
--------------------
Whenever	possible	,	missing	scenes	from	the	Federal	Film	Archive	and	the	Munich	Film	Museum	were	inserted	.
In	its	present	form	,	the	film	runs	121	minutes	.
The	film	was	restored	by	the	German	Film	Institute	(	DlF	)	in	collaboration	with	the	Federal	Film	Archive	,	the	Munich	Film	Museum	,
KirchMedia	and	ZDF/	ARTE	.

You	know	that	one	,	Müiler	?
Those	are	the	girls	who	carry	dead	police	inspectors	directly	up	to	heaven	from	the	Alexanderplatz	with	a	"	Hey	ho	.	"
On	horseback	.
--------------------
Horseback	?
Certainly	.
Expenses	don	't	allow	for	a	car	.
Well	,	Inspector	,	when	it	comes	to	corpses	,	the	state	sometimes	has	...	a	fit	of	generosity	.
That	's	what	you	think	.
Believe	it	or	not	,	Müiler	,	tonight	will	be	the	first	time
I	make	it	to	the	theater	in	time	for	the	first	act	.
Knock	on	wood	,	Inspector	.
There	.
What	did	I	tell	you	?

Tell	'em	I	'm	dead	.
Police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Inspector	.
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Hofmeister	would	like	to	speak	with	you	,	Inspector	.
What	?
Our	former	colleague	who	got	into	trouble	with	foreign	currency	?
That	scoundrel	?
--------------------
Tell	him	his	call	is	the	most	shameless	affront
I	've	ever	experienced	!
And	tell	him	to	go	to	hell	!
I	'm	sorry	,	but	Inspector	Lohmann	has	already	left	and	he	says	you
And	he	says	you	can	go	to	hell	!
God	help	me	!
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	Müiler	.
I	once	had	high	hopes	for	that	fellow	Hofmeister	.
I	gave	him	his	first	chance	.
And	what	does	the	scoundrel	do	?
--------------------
He	takes	a	bribe	from	a	black-	market	currency	trader	.
Phooey	!

Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
He	has	to	hear	me	out	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Tell	him	it	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	,	I	think	you	really	ought	to
Of	course	I	'll	miss	the	first	act	again	!
--------------------
I	want	to	redeem	myself	in	his	eyes	!
I	finally	figured	out	their	scheme	.
It	's	a	monstrous	business	!
They	've	nearly	done	me	in	three	times	!
I	hardly	dare	cross	the	street	!
Lohmann	speaking	.
What	is	it	?
Inspector	?
Thank	you	.
Cut	out	the	nonsense	and	tell	me	what	's	wrong	.
--------------------
Yes	,	Inspector	.
I	've	finally	discovered
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
Just	in	case	,	Inspector	,	please	have	a	record	made	of	my	report	.
Headphones	.
Take	this	down	.
I	was	actually	tracing	counterfeit	money	.
I	wanted	to	redeem	myself	in	your	eyes	,	Inspector	.
For	four	days	-	96	hours
I	lay	up	there	at	the	air	vent	,	and	now	I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	.
--------------------
But	you	'll	probably	think	I	'm	crazy	.
Who	is	it	?
I	swear	I	'm	telling	the	truth	.
I	know	who	's	behind	it	all	!
I	heard	his	name	with	my	own	ears	!
And	now	they	know	I	know	the	name	.
Can	you	trace	that	call	?
For	God	's	sake	!
Hofmeister	!
What	street	?
--------------------
Number	23	?
Thanks	.
Dear	God	.
He	must	have	gone	out	of	his	mind	from	terror	.
A	pathological	condition	that	is	not	as	rare	as	one	might	suspect	.
Exposure	to	catastrophes	such	as	explosions	,	earthquakes	and	railway	accidents	-	in	short	,	exposure	to	fright	and	horror	often	triggers	insanity	.
Perhaps	the	most	interesting	case	of	such	pathological	conditions	is	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Here	he	goes	again	.
I	shall	briefly	recount	the	history	of	this	case	.
The	patient	lived	a	decidedly	double	life	.
--------------------
He	was	a	renowned	doctor	with	a	large	private	practice	.
Aided	by	an	almost	superhuman	logic	,	he	used	his	profound	knowledge	of	hypnosis	to	commit	crimes	of	a	magnitude	previously	deemed	impossible	.
For	months	the	police	sought	the	mastermind	behind	those	crimes	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	.
At	last	they	discovered	his	whereabouts	.
But	Mabuse	decided	not	to	flee	but	rather	to	mount	armed	resistance	,	and	he	barricaded	himself	in	his	house	with	four	loyal	henchmen	.
He	refused	demands	to	surrender	to	state	authorities	,	saying	,
"	I	am	the	state	!	"
A	barrage	of	bullets	forced	the	police	to	retreat	.
Finally	,	soldiers	stormed	the	house	with	hand	grenades	.
Two	of	the	defenders	were	killed	.
--------------------
We	observed	that	Mabuse	's	hand	continuously	made	writing	motions	in	the	air	,	on	the	wall	and	on	the	bedspread	.
We	gave	him	pencil	and	paper	.
At	first	,	he	covered	the	paper	with	senseless	scribbling	.
Two	years	ago	,	however	,	certain	words	began	to	appear	on	the	paper	.
Then	,	sentences	began	to	form	,	still	meaningless	and	confused	.
Gradually	they	grew	more	coherent	and	logical	,	and	at	last	we	began	to	get	glimpses	into	the	extraordinary	phenomenon	that	was	his	mind	.
His	thoughts	still	move	in	the	same	criminal	channels	as	before	.
Whatever	Mabuse	writes	is	based	upon	incontrovertible	logic	and	serves	as	a	perfect	guide	for	the	commission	of	crimes	worked	out	to	the	minutest	detail	.
No	.
Nothing	can	happen	to	us	if	we	follow	the	doctor	's	methods	.
--------------------
Oh	,	yeah	?
What	do	you	mean	,	"	oh	,	yeah	"	?
The	first	attacks	on	the	snitch	failed	.
So	what	?
Tough	luck	.
So	we	called	in	Division	2-	B	to	handle	the	matter	.
If	they	succeed	,	fine	.
And	if	they	don	't	-	if	it	looks	like	that	snitch	might	rat	on	us	-	one	single	phone	call	and	this	whole	place	gets	blown	sky-	high	.
Stop	scratching	,	Fritzi	.
It	won	't	come	to	that	.
--------------------
Before	that	guy	can	open	his	mouth	,	he	'll	be	done	for	.
I	'd	feel	better	if	they	didn	't	resort	to	murder	.
What	do	you	mean	,	murder	?
A	guy	can	have	something	fall	on	his	head	,	can	't	he	?
A	nice	,	clean	little	accident	.
I	don	't	care	how	you	make	it	look	.
I	just	don	't	want	anything	to	do	with	murder	.
Scared	?
Can	't	bear	the	sight	of	blood	?
Let	me	tell	you	something	,	though	it	's	really	none	of	your	damn	business	.
--------------------
I	've	killed	two	people	.
I	know	what	it	means	to	kill	.
And	that	's	precisely	why
I	want	nothing	to	do	with	murder	.
Leave	him	alone	,	Fritzi	.
What	do	you	know	about	Kent	?
The	phone	!
Yeah	?
It	's	been	taken	care	of	?
Bravo	!
--------------------
Really	?
Just	20	minutes	later	?
Lohmann	himself	?
Continue	writing	.
Hofmeister	himself	has	disappeared	.
The	rug	has	been	moved	toward	the	window	.
He	was	on	the	phone	when	the	lights	went	out	.
Where	's	the	light	switch	?
Here	by	the	door	.
So	it	came	from	over	there	,	the	unknown	horror	,	the	thing	that	caused	his	mind	to	snap	.
--------------------
And	he	backed	away	from	it	step	by	step	,	right	up	to	the	window	.
I	wonder	if	he
No	,	he	couldn	't	get	out	this	way	.
Certainly	not	downward	.
Well	,	I	'll	be	damned	!
Actual	letters	scratched	into	the	glass	with	a	ring	.
So	he	was	trying	to	tell	me	something	.
Is	that	a	W	?
No	.
Could	it	be	a	name	?
--------------------
It	may	take	us	a	while	to	figure	that	one	out	.
Hey	,	Krüger	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Take	this	pane	of	glass	to	my	office	at	headquarters	.
And	see	that	you	don	't	break	it	,	or	I	'll	bite	your	head	off	.
That	's	odd	.
I	wonder	what	's	behind	that	.
Thirty	pages	today	,	Professor	.
Thank	you	.
Keep	a	careful	eye	on	him	tonight	.
--------------------
I	don	't	like	his	pulse	.
In	any	case	,	give	him	a	shot	later	so	he	can	get	some	rest	.
Yes	,	Professor	.
Their	famous	chocolate	shake	?
And	a	double	mocha	for	you	,	sir	?
With	hot	cream	.
As	usual	.
Very	well	.
And	now	tell	me	,	Tom	.
Why	did	you	ask	to	see	me	so	urgently	today	?
--------------------
Don	't	you	know	what	today	is	,	Lilli	?
Today	?
Too	bad	.
Won	't	you	tell	me	?
Certainly	.
A	chocolate	shake	and	a	double	mocha	with	hot	cream	.
Well	,	Tom	?
You	ask	what	day	this	is	?
Exactly	one	year	ago	today	,
No	smoking	,	gentlemen	.
--------------------
Smoking	is	prohibited	.
Good	heavens	,	my	friend	,	are	you	back	again	?
I	've	told	you	a	hundred	times	there	's	no	point	in	coming	every	day	.
When	we	have	work	for	you	,	we	'll	certainly	notify	you	.
I	've	been	waiting	for	three	months	!
Be	reasonable	.
Reasonable	?
What	does	reasonable	mean	when	a	man	is	going	under	?
I	want	to	work	!
But	they	keep	pushing	me	closer	to	the	edge	!
--------------------
It	's	enough	to	drive	a	man	to	crime	!
He	's	forced	to	become	a	criminal	!
He	marches	in	here	and	causes	a	riot	!
Don	't	get	so	worked	up	.
We	have	others	to	attend	to	.
Come	now	.
Leave	him	alone	.
He	's	sick	.
Come	now	.
Don	't	touch	me	!
--------------------
I	'll	go	on	my	own	!
You	'll	never	see	me	again	here	!
Next	,	please	.
You	've	seen	the	last	of	me	!
Just	a	moment	,	please	.
I	can	't	bear	to	see	you	leave	like	this	.
Here	are	20	marks	.
It	's	all	I	have	right	now	,	but	I	'd	like	you	to	have	it	.
It	may	help	you	out	.
I	don	't	want	charity	.
--------------------
I	want	work	,	not	a	handout	.
It	's	not	a	handout	.
It	's	just	a	loan	.
I	'm	sure	you	'll	be	able	to	pay	me	back	.
Please	.
Yes	.
And	six	months	later	,	you	found	work	and	promptly	paid	back	my	20	marks	.
Tell	me	,	Lilli	...
have	you	ever	been	in	love	?
It	's	high	time	I	was	going	.
--------------------
Here	comes	my	bus	.
Please	stay	.
I	can	't	.
I	've	got	to	run	.
Good-	bye	,	Tom	.
Call	me	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
If	you	'll	be	seated	,	Doctor	,	the	professor	is	due	back	any	moment	.
Thanks	,	Winkler	.
--------------------
I	'm	sure	I	'll	find	what	I	need	.
Ah	,	I	see	it	's	on	his	desk	.
Oops	.
Oh	,	dear	!
What	order	does	all	this	go	in	?
This	junk	isn	't	even	numbered	.
What	is	this	anyway	?
NOTES	BY	DR.	MABUSE	SEPTEMBER	1	ST	-	OCTOBER	31	ST
How	does	this	go	together	now	?
No	,	the	other	way	around	.
--------------------
Then	this	page	.
What	's	the	next	part	?
"	Jewel	-	"
No	.
"	Jewel
ry	store	.	"
"	Jewelry	store	...	specializing	in	high-	quality	...	"
What	?
"	The	least	conspicuous	and	therefore	most	effective	precaution	to	prevent	interruption	by	police	,	pedestrians	and	clients	is	to	pull	the	shades	and	hang	a	sign	on	the	door	:
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
--------------------
Well	,	I	'll	be	!
"	The	criminals	then	lowered	the	shades	and	hung	a	sign	outside	the	door	,
'	Closed	from	10	:	00	to	2	:	00	for	inventory	.	"	'
If	that	isn	't	something	!
That	's	incredible	!
"	lmmobilize	the	staff	by	using	gas	in	bulbs	of	thin	glass	,	which	will	burst	almost	inaudibly	when	tossed	.	"
Gas	!
Amazing	!
Identical	,	almost	to	the	word	!
"	The	criminals	appear	to	have	tossed	bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
--------------------
"	Bulbs	of	thin	glass	filled	with	gas	.	"
If	that	isn	't	odd	!
It	's	as	if	they	were	following	a	blueprint	!
What	are	you	doing	there	?
Baum	.
This	is	the	most	incredible	thing	you	could	imagine	.
Look	here	.
What	is	this	?
Where	did	you	get	these	papers	?
Never	mind	that	!
--------------------
You	know	what	they	are	?
Yes	,	of	course	.
Now	read	this	.
"	Ingenious	jewelry	heist	...	"
That	's	right	.
Read	it	.
"	Jewelry	stolen	valued	at	250,	000	marks	.
Gas	was	used	on	the	employees	.	"
Yes	,	just	as	if	they	were	following	your	Dr.	Mabuse	's	instructions	.
A	curious	coincidence	.
--------------------
Now	wait	just	a	minute	.
You	call	that	a	coincidence	?
What	else	?
Baum	,	old	man	,	coincidences	like	that	just	don	't	happen	.
There	's	some	connection	in	all	this	or	I	'll	eat	my	hat	.
Say	,	I	've	got	a	crazy	idea	.
Could	this	Mabuse	fellow	be	faking	it	?
Maybe	the	guy	isn	't	insane	after	all	.
Tell	me	,	do	you	think	that	,	after	treating	a	patient	for	years	,
I	can	't	judge	whether	he	's	really	sick	or	just	pretending	?
--------------------
I	didn	't	mean	it	like	that	.
But	there	must	be	something	behind	all	this	.
You	know	what	a	genius	this	fellow	was	.
It	's	just	possible	that	his	dead	brain	has	come	back	to	life	.
Couldn	't	Mabuse	be	writing	these	things	as	a	sort	of	blueprint	for	a	gang	of	accomplices	?
You	've	always	had	a	wild	imagination	.
Just	hear	me	out	.
What	if	Mabuse	,	with	his	incredible	hypnotic	powers	,	engaged	in	some	kind	of	telepathic	hypnosis	from	his	cell	?
Nonsense	!
Nonsense	?
--------------------
Say	what	you	like	,	but	there	's	something	weird	going	on	!
Who	else	besides	you	knows	about	Mabuse	's	notes	?
You	sound	just	like	a	policeman	.
I	think	the	police	should	be	informed	of	this	strange	coincidence	.
The	police	?
Of	course	!
Well	,	perhaps
Of	course	you	're	right	.
The	police	would	want	to	know	of	this	.
Of	course	!
--------------------
I	'll	go	to	them	at	once	.
If	I	can	,	I	'll	call	you	from	the	station	.
Good-	bye	.
Please	drive	carefully	,	Doctor	.
It	's	been	raining	.
Thank	you	,	Winkler	.

INGENlOUS	JEWELRY	HElST
STOLEN	JEWELRY	VALUED	AT	250,	000	MARKS
Almost	a	quarter	million	in	jewels	.
--------------------
Pearls	,	platinum	,	gold	.
One	can	do	a	lot	with	that	.
Can	?
Could	!
But	what	will	be	done	with	it	?
What	's	gonna	happen	with	that	quarter	million	?
Careful	.
I	ask	you
Will	you	stay	down	?
What	becomes	of	it	,	I	ask	you	?
--------------------
We	buy	cocaine	with	it	,	morphine	,	heroin	,	opium	,	whatever	you	call	all	that	crap	.
And	instead	of	making	a	killing	off	the	dope	and	fleecing	the	types	who	are	crazy	for	the	stuff	,	they	practically	give	it	away	.
What	good	does	it	do	the	boss	to	pump	the	world	full	of	dope	and	not	make	any	money	off	it	?
These	things	won	't	stay	down	.
What	does	it	get	him	?
I	follow	his	instructions	and	drive	ten	people	nearly	crazy	with	threats	and	blackmail	.
And	when	they	're	ready	to	pay	any	sum	we	ask	,	then	I	'm	told	to	back	off	and	forget	about	the	money	.
Only	result	is	they	're	driven	crazy	from	fear	of	a	scandal	.
Is	that	any	business	of	yours	,	old	boy	?
Did	you	ever	fail	to	get	your	pay	on	time	?
--------------------
That	's	not	what	I	'm	saying	.
Okay	,	then	.
You	handle	the	blackmail	,	and	I	see	to	your	alibi	.
We	get	our	paychecks	like	clockwork	,	so	what	are	you	growling	about	?
I	'm	not	growling	.
I	just	don	't	get	it	.
If	a	woman	throws	herself	out	the	window	,	or	a	fellow	blows	his	brains	out	,	like	that	bank	director	,	blackmail	letters	aren	't	of	much	use	.
150	grand	tossed	in	the	gutter	.
Is	there	any	sense	in	that	?
Or	take	the	new	instructions	about	the	explosives	,	and	stealing	poison	from	drugstores	-	that	's	scary	business	.
--------------------
As	it	's	meant	to	be	,	my	dear	fellow	.
But	why	,	in	the	devil	's	name	?
I	think	you	ask	too	many	questions	.
The	boss	doesn	't	like	that	.
What	?
You	know	him	?
No	more	than	you	do	,	or	anyone	else	in	our	gang	.
And	I	'm	not	the	least	bit	curious	.
I	learned	my	lesson	from	your	predecessor	.
He	just	had	to	find	out	what	the	man	looked	like	,	the	man	behind	the	curtain	,	the	boss	.
--------------------
So	one	day	,	without	having	been	summoned	,
Cut	it	out	,	man	.
You	're	spoiling	my	appetite	.
Let	me	give	you	a	tip	.
Let	the	boss	worry	about	this	stuff	.
We	're	well	paid	.
In	fact	,	very	well	paid	.
If	something	goes	wrong	,	we	'll	have	cast-	iron	alibis	or	a	top-	notch	lawyer	.
The	boss	thinks	of	everything	and	takes	care	of	everything	and	demands	not	a	penny	for	himself	of	all	the	loot	.
Not	a	penny	.
--------------------
See	?
That	's	just	it	.
Why	?
Why	doesn	't	he	take	a	single	penny	for	himself	?
I	can	't	understand	that	,	and	that	's	what	's	got	me	jumpy	.
Lots	of	others	in	our	gang	probably	feel	the	same	and	would	like	to	be	done	with	the	whole	thing	but	just	don	't	know	how	.
"	Dearest	Lilli	,	you	dashed	off	so	quickly	this	afternoon	that	I	had	no	chance	to	say	what	I	wanted	to	tell	you	.
I	-	"
TONlGHT	AT	1	:	00	A.	M.	-	DR.	MABUSE
Inspector	Lohmann	asks	if	you	had	the	hospitals	searched	.
--------------------
A	special	squad	did	that	,	and	Hofmeister	hasn	't	been	admitted	anywhere	?
Damn	it	!
You	'll	call	back	?
Wait	a	minute	.
Get	a	picture	of	Hofmeister	from	the	files	.
We	may	need	to	have	posters	printed	up	.
Now	,	then	,	what	is	your	assessment	of	the	murder	in	the	automobile	?
So	far	,	all	I	know	is	that	the	killer	used	a	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	,	from	1906	,	production	of	which	ended	in	1916	.
This	weapon	was	fired	from	a	distance	of	not	more	than	25	feet	.
No	empty	shells	were	found	in	the	street	nor	on	the	sidewalk	,	and	the	bullet	's	trajectory	indicates	the	shot	was	not	fired	from	a	window	but	rather	from	a	point	almost	level	with	the	victim	's	head	.
--------------------
We	may	therefore	conclude	the	shot	was	fired	from	another	vehicle	.
Another	vehicle	?
That	would	be	very	interesting	indeed	.
That	opens	up	a	whole	new	perspective	.
Inspector	Lohmann	's	office	.
Not	bad	.
Excuse	me	,	Inspector	.
It	's	Habermann	.
This	is	about	the	Kramm	homicide	.
Inspector	,	we	've	traced	the	murder	victim	's	actions	up	until	6	:	10	on	the	evening	of	the	murder	.
--------------------
Where	he	was	from	then	until	the	time	of	death	we	have	not	yet	been	able	to	establish	.
But	that	's	what	we	need	to	find	out	.
See	that	you	find	out	where	he	was	those	last	two	hours	.
Very	well	.
Müiler	,	arrange	to	have	-	No	,	wait	.
Where	's	the	text	for	the	Kramm	homicide	poster	?
Here	it	is	.
"	All	information	will	be	kept	confidential	"
Put	another	line	in	here	:
"	Especially	concerning	the	hours	from	6	:	00	to	8	:	00	p	.	m	.	"
--------------------
Have	those	changes	made	.
And	-	No	,	never	mind	.
I	'll	do	it	myself	.
Photo	department	.
Weber	,	the	old	man	wants	to	talk	to	you	.
Trouble	?
I	don	't	know	.
Weber	here	.
I	'm	just	doing	it	now	.
Enlargements	,	naturally	.

Trace	the	scratches	and	see	if	you	can	't	link	them	together	into	a	word	or	name	or	something	.
I	'm	sure	Hofmeister	intended	to
Inspector	,	they	found	Hofmeister	!
Where	?
The	police	station	at	Schöneberger	Ufer	.
A	police	patrol	found	him	.
At	first	they	thought	he	was	just	another	drunk	because	he	kept	babbling	to	himself	incessantly	.
But	then	they	heard	him	call	your	name	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
Why	won	't	you	listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	?
--------------------
Inspector	,	you	must	listen	to	me	.
It	's	a	matter	of	life	and	death	.
Inspector	Lohmann	,	please	listen	,	for	the	love	of	God	!
My	God	!
You	see	?
The	moment	he	thinks	he	's	being	watched	,	he	starts	singing	.
When	he	thinks	he	's	alone	,	he	calls	your	name	.
I	'll	leave	you	alone	now	.
Hofmeister	,	don	't	you	recognize	me	?
Goddamn	it	!
--------------------
Hofmeister	,	it	's	me	,	Lohmann	.
Your	old	friend	Lohmann	.
My	God	!
Inspector	?
Inspector	Lohmann	?
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	?
For	God	's	sake	,	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Come	to	the	phone	!
Hello	.
This	is	Lohmann	.
--------------------
Detective	Inspector	Lohmann	.
Who	is	it	,	please	?
Inspector	?
Is	that	you	,	Hofmeister	?
This	is	Lohmann	.
Hopeless	.
We	'll	have	no	other	choice	but	to	commit	the	poor	devil	to	an	institution	.
Listen	to	me	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Why	don	't	you	come	to	the	phone	,	Inspector	?
Poor	devil	,	eh	?
--------------------
Heaven	help	me	if	I	ever	get	my	hands	on	the	scoundrel	responsible	for	that	fellow	's	condition	!
All	of	a	sudden	he	stopped	writing	and	just	sat	there	like	a	living	corpse	.
Then	he	suddenly	got	an	expression	in	his	eyes	,
If	he	were	in	his	right	mind	,
I	believe	he	could	compel	people	to	do	his	will	right	from	his	cell	.
The	professor	must	come	.
The	professor	is	working	and	doesn	't	wish	to	be	disturbed	.
Winkler	,	this	is	Mabuse	!
Not	so	loud	!
The	professor	will	fire	me	on	the	spot	.

MURDER	-	2,	000	MARKS	REWARD
Murder	.
No	!
It	's	really	none	of	my	business	,	but	I	don	't	think	you	're	taking	the	doctor	's	warning	seriously	enough	.
Oh	,	yes	,	I	am	.
Division	2-	B.
No	one	in	the	organization	gets	out	of	it	alive	.
It	's	hopeless	.
"	I	must	say	farewell	forever	,	and	I	can	't	even	tell	you	why	.
But	there	's	no	other	way	for	me	to	behave	decently	towards	you	.
--------------------
You	will	never	know	what	you	've	meant	in	my	botched	life	.
It	is	very	difficult	to	say	good-	bye	to	you	,	Lilli	.	"
"	Forget	me	-	though	I	shall	never	forget	you	!	"
It	spells	Mabuse	.
What	spells	Mabuse	?
Those	scratches	on	the	windowpane	,	Inspector	.
It	took	me	forever	to	discover	he	was	writing	as	if	in	a	mirror	.
Using	his	left	hand	,	and	behind	his	back	.
If	you	flip	it	over	,	see	there	?
Quite	clear	.

Wasn	't	he	that
Quite	right	.

I	've	got	him	.

Dr.	Mabuse	"	The	Gambler	.	"
Come	on	,	let	me	see	that	.
Let	's	see	what	business	he	has	being	on	that	windowpane	.
then	you	may	sweep	up	as	much	as	you	like	.
But	until	then	,	he	'll	go	wild	as	an	ape	if	you	touch	anything	,	and	he	bites	.
--------------------
I	'd	like	to	see	him	try	.
The	old	man	's	coming	.
Get	out	!
Müiler	,	come	here	.
Call	up	G9-	19-	902	.
That	's	the	mental	hospital	run	by	Professor	Baum	where	they	committed	a	certain	Dr.	Mabuse	.
I	'd	like	to	know	if	he	's	still	there	.
When	?
Thank	you	.
Dr.	Mabuse	died	this	morning	.
--------------------
This	morning	?
Today	of	all	days	.
That	is	quite	peculiar	.
TONlGHT	AT	12	:	00	-	DR.	MABUSE
So	,	you	too	?
What	do	you	mean	,	me	too	?
Something	big	is	on	for	tonight	,	it	seems	.
We	've	been	called	in	,	as	have	Divisions	5	and	9	...	as	well	as	Section	2-	B.
Good	Lord	.
It	's	no	use	,	Kent	.
--------------------
The	doctor	is	more	powerful	than	you	.
Is	your	curiosity	satisfied	now	,
Inspector	?
And	this	corpse	is	clearly	identified	as	Mabuse	?
There	's	no	doubt	of	that	?
Unfortunately	not	,	Inspector	.
Unfortunately	it	is	only	too	certain	that	this	dead	man	here	is	Dr.	Mabuse	.
Or	was	.
Alas	.
This	assessment	of	the	deceased
--------------------
Is	smoking	permitted	here	?
Yes	.
seems	to	me	to	be	slightly	,	let	's	say
Do	you	smoke	?
No	,	thanks	.
let	's	say	slightly	exaggerated	.
In	the	case	of	Dr.	Mabuse	,	we	're	not	dealing	with	a	human	being	of	value	but	with	an	evil	criminal	who	only	escaped	the	gallows	by	entering	an	insane	asylum	.
One	less	insane	criminal	in	the	world	.
Silence	!
You	have	no	idea	.
--------------------
No	one	has	any	idea	what	kind	of	phenomenal	,	superhuman	mind	has	come	to	an	end	with	Dr.	Mabuse	's	death	.
This	mind	would	have	laid	waste	to	our	whole	rotten	world	,	which	is	long	overdue	for	destruction	.
This	godless	world	,	devoid	of	justice	and	compassion	,	consisting	only	of	selfishness	,	cruelty	and	hatred	.
This	mind	would	have	destroyed	mankind	,	which	itself	knows	only	destruction	and	extermination	and	which	could	only	have	been	saved	in	its	final	hour	through	terror	and	horror	.
Mabuse	the	criminal	?
Mabuse	the	genius	!
His	intellectual	legacy	would	have	turned	your	world	,	with	its	police	protection	,	on	its	head	!
His	legacy	?
You	speak	of	Mabuse	's	legacy	?
No	.
--------------------
Yes	.
Of	course	,	not	a	testament	in	the	accepted	sense	of	the	word	.
Just	some	of	his	notes	,	of	interest	only	to	physicians	and	men	of	science	.
I	'm	afraid	,	Professor	,	that	you	underestimate	the	number	of	subjects	in	which	I	take	an	interest	.
Take	,	for	example	,	a	case	which	concerns	me	intimately	.
Wasn	't	a	young	man	admitted	to	your	institution	earlier	today	by	the	name	of	Hofmeister	?
May	I	see	that	man	?
I	'm	terribly	sorry	,	Inspector	.
That	man	seems	to	be	suffering	the	effects	of	some	frightful	experience	that	he	relives	each	time	someone	approaches	him	.
Then	he	begins	singing	like	a	frightened	child	sings	in	the	dark	.
--------------------
I	must	therefore	request	,	for	the	good	of	the	patient	,	that	you	refrain	from	seeing	him	now	.
What	is	it	?
Forgive	me	,	Professor	.
We	only	wanted	to
They	're	waiting	for	you	in	anatomy	class	.
Yes	,	of	course	.
Well	,	I	see	the	doctor	's	cell	is	already	occupied	again	.
Yes	,	the	new	one	who	arrived	last	night	.
The	professor	ordered	that	he	be	isolated	.
The	doctor	's	cell	just	became	vacant	,	so	we	put	him	in	it	.
--------------------
It	's	strange	when	you	come	to	think	of	it	.
For	10	years	I	've	cared	for	the	doctor	,	and	now	he	lies	down	there	in	the	morgue	.
Or	what	's	left	of	him	.

Per	my	orders	,	the	letters	incriminating	the	signatory	of	the	Overseas	Bank	were	not	returned	to	him	,	even	when	very	large	sums	were	offered	,	until	he	agreed	to	comply	completely	with	our	demands	.

Only	after	successful	completion	of	our	mission	will	the	letters	be	returned	.
I	LOVE	YOU	!
Good	evening	,	Tom	.
I	was	here	in	the	afternoon	,	too	,	but	you	weren	't	home	.
Nor	were	you	here	earlier	this	evening	.
So	I	waited	,	Tom	,	a	terribly	long	time	.
Won	't	you	at	least	offer	me	a	seat	in	return	,	Tom	?
--------------------
What	a	lovely	place	you	have	here	.
I	like	rooms	that	have	such	wide	,	tall	windows	.
Lovely	.
Is	this	true	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
But	I	wrote	to	you	!
And	I	gave	you	my	answer	,	Tom	.
But	you	don	't	even	know	who	I	am	,	Lilli	.
My	dear	Tom	,	isn	't	that	entirely	beside	the	point	?
Beside	the	point	?
--------------------
Entirely	beside	the	point	!
We	'll	see	right	now	whether	it	's	beside	the	point	!
There	you	have	it	,	in	black	and	white	-	just	who	I	am	.
Official	confirmation	with	the	seal	and	signature	of	the	prison	director	and	everything	that	goes	with	it	.
Prison	.
Yes	,	prison	!
Four	and	a	half	years	in	prison	!
The	last	six	months	commuted	for	good	behavior	.
There	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
--------------------
I	love	you	.
You	don	't	know	why	I	was	in	prison	.
I	killed	two	people	.
One	was	my	girlfriend	,	and	the	other	was	the	man	I	'd	thought	was	my	best	friend	.
Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.
Then	I	'm	forced	to	tell	you	the	rest	,	Lilli	.
I	...
I	lied	to	you	,	Lilli	!
I	told	you	I	'd	found	a	position	,	didn	't	I	?
--------------------
Well	,	I	certainly	did	.
Do	you	know	where	?
In	a	counterfeiting	lab	.
That	's	one	place	that	can	use	an	engineer	who	's	an	ex-	con	.
If	I	had	only	known	what	I	know	now	.
You	see	,	Lilli	?
This	time	you	don	't	say	,
"	Why	should	I	care	,	Tom	?
I	love	you	.	"
Look	,	Tom	.
--------------------
When	I	received	your	letter	,	did	you	really	think	me	so	dense	that	I	wouldn	't	sense	the	despair	in	your	heart	?
I	thought	to	myself	,
"	What	he	needs	is	to	regain	his	faith	in	himself	,	to	believe	that	everything	can	turn	out	well	again	.	"
And	I	thought	to	myself	,
"	Maybe	you	can	restore	his	faith	in	himself	if	you	tell	him	how	much	you	care	for	him	and	that	you	will	stand	by	him	for	better	or	for	worse	.	"
And	so	I	came	to	you	.
Tell	me	,	have	you	taken	it	upon	yourself	to	rob	me	of	my	last	shred	of	sanity	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
You	!
You	!
--------------------
You	have	to	report	that	he	's	failed	to	show	up	.
Let	's	wait	.
Finished	.
I	guess	I	have	no	other	choice	.
Section	2-	B	?
Yes	.
This	is	Division	3	.
I	must	report	that	Kent	didn	't	show	up	.
Believe	me	,	Tom	,	your	life	is	just	beginning	.
A	brand-	new	life	,	clean	,	spotless	and	good	.
--------------------
It	's	true	,	Tom	!
We	'll	put	it	all	behind	us	and	make	a	fresh	start	.
And	you	know	who	'll	help	us	?
Help	us	?
Yes	,	Tom	.
The	man	who	once
When	he	had	to	arrest	you	,	he	was	so	decent	and	compassionate	towards	you	.
Lohmann	?
Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
--------------------
Voberg	is	here	.
He	claims	to	have	some	important	news	.
Give	me	a	cigar	and	raise	the	shades	.
Then	show	him	in	.
Morning	,	Inspector	.
What	is	it	?
Well	,	Inspector	,	it	's	like	this	.
Scholz	and	I	think	we	've	stumbled	across	something
Lower	those	shades	.
Clumsy	fool	.
--------------------
We	stumbled	across	something	that	might	lead	us	to	the	jewelry	robbers	.
Is	that	so	?
We	saw	a	girl	running	around	with	a	big	pearl	necklace	.
She	could	tell	me	anything	at	all	,	that	she	bought	the	thing	at	Woolworth	's	for	25	pfennigs	.
But	Scholz	knows	about	these	things	,	and	he	swears	that	necklace	is	genuine	.
Well	,	is	it	?
So	far	all	we	know	is	that	she	's	the	sweetheart	of	a	scoundrel	who	's	an	expert	on	anything	having	to	do	with	jewelry	robberies	.
Where	are	the	others	?
They	had	a	few	details	to	take	care	of	.
Come	along	,	quietly	.
--------------------
Come	along	,	Kent	.
Come	on	,	let	's	go	!
Off	you	go	,	then	,	but	remember	:
Be	careful	.
You	're	dealing	with	a	dangerous	international	crook	.
Understand	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
All	right	then	.
Good	luck	.
Good	day	,	Chief	.
--------------------
Let	the	woman	go	free	.
Do	with	me	what	you	like	,	but	let	her	go	free	.
You	monster	!
Tom	,	for	God	's	sake	!
Stay	back	!
Good	God	!
What	's	that	?
Tom	,	what	's	that	?
What	's	that	,	Tom	?
Whatever	it	is	,	Lilli	,	we	must	find	it	and	put	an	end	to	it	.
--------------------
He	won	't	be	able	to	do	it	anymore	.
What	do	you	mean	?
He	's	otherwise	engaged	.
Who	could	that	be	?
How	do	I	know	?
Maybe	it	's	the	mailman	.
Anni	!
Wanna	go	and	see	who	that	is	?
Hold	on	.
Who	is	it	?
--------------------
The	gas	man	.
I	'd	like	to	inspect	the	meter	.
Afternoon	,	miss	.
You	want	to	look	at	the	meter	?
Come	back	some	other	time	.
I	've	got	company	right	now	.
How	dare	you	!
Police	.
Open	up	.
Look	out	!
--------------------
Police	!
Don	't	shoot	!
Shut	up	,	you	idiot	!
Get	out	!
Quick	,	out	the	back	door	!
We	don	't	have	one	!
You	idiots	get	an	apartment	with	only	one	exit	?
What	about	the	window	?
From	the	fourth	floor	?
There	must	be	some	way	out	!
--------------------
Shall	I	put	in	an	elevator	for	you	guys	?
Now	we	're	really	done	for	!
That	guy	will	call	all	his	cop	friends	.
And	on	a	Sunday	,	too	.
What	're	you	crying	about	?
It	's	your	own	damn	fault	for	firing	at	him	!
Leave	me	alone	,	you	hear	?
Stop	giving	me	a	hard	time	!
Listen	,	try	to	knock	a	hole	through	the	ceiling	.
Maybe	we	can	escape	to	the	roof	.
--------------------
I	'll	try	to	hit	the	guy	and	keep	him	back	from	the	door	!
Stay	back	.
Notify	the	Special	Tactics	Squad	and	get	hold	of
Damned	scoundrel	!
Who	should	I	get	hold	of	?
Homicide	.
Inspector	Lohmann	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	'll	never	get	out	this	way	.
The	window	,	Tom	.
--------------------
We	could	try	to	break	through	that	.
Cement	.
But	the	brick	,	maybe	.
Damn	it	!
Hey	!
How	far	are	you	in	there	?
I	can	't	hold	this	door	forever	.
Lohmann	and	his	whole	gang	are	here	.
Lohmann	?
That	's	it	!
--------------------
I	'm	out	!
Get	yourself	killed	,	all	of	you	!
What	do	you	mean	by	that	?
What	do	I	mean	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	I	mean	!
Watch	the	door	!
Out	of	the	way	.
Hardy	,	be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	won	't	get	anywhere	on	the	roof	.
--------------------
Let	me	talk	to	them	.
Let	me	tell	you	something	.
Anyone	who	gets	near	that	door	,	inside	or	out	,	is	gonna	get	it	,	understand	?
Go	keep	an	eye	on	them	!
Move	it	!
Almost	.
Now	.
Let	's	see	now	.
What	's	the	matter	,	Tom	?
It	's	no	use	,	Lilli	.
--------------------
Behind	those	bricks	is	a	steel	plate	.
Dear	God	!
Careful	!
A	bullet	can	cripple	you	for	life	!
Is	he	dead	?
Karetzky	.
Goddamn	this	mess	!
Anni	,	get	some	towels	.
Come	on	,	quick	!
It	's	no	use	.
--------------------
Better	keep	an	eye	on	the	door	.
Why	didn	't	you	let	me	negotiate	?
You	and	your	stupid	shooting	!
Bredow	,	shoot	anyone	who	comes	near	the	door	!
Do	you	hear	?
You	bet	I	will	!
I	've	had	enough	of	this	business	.
I	've	got	you	now	.
Open	up	!
It	's	Lohmann	!
--------------------
What	's	the	matter	?
Lohmann	's	outside	.
I	forbid	you	to	go	!
Who	are	you	to	forbid	anything	?
I	won	't	land	in	jail	'cause	of	you	!
Think	I	'll	let	you	cowardly	swine	send	me	to	the	slaughter	?
Be	sensible	.
It	's	no	use	.
We	've	got	hand	grenades	.
I	'll	give	you	one	last	chance	.
--------------------
If	you	're	reasonable	,	we	'll	be	reasonable	too	.
That	's	the	way	.
Attaboy	.
Daddy	's	proud	of	you	.
Now	,	open	the	door	and	put	your	hands	up	.
How	many	of	you	are	there	?
Five	,	Inspector	.
One	,	two	,	three	.
Diamond	Anna	!
See	you	don	't	catch	a	cold	,	my	dear	.
--------------------
Four	.
Where	's	the	fifth	?
Damn	it	!
Don	't	try	anything	!
A	Dreyse	pistol	.
What	do	you	know	?
A	Dreyse	pistol	,	no	less	.
Made	in	1906	,	7	.	65-	mm	.
Apparently	the	former	owner	-	a	friend	of	yours
No	.
--------------------
No	?
That	's	funny	.
It	says	here	that	the	two	of	you	were	close	friends	.
It	's	signed	by	Karetzky	,	Diamond	Anna	,	and	her	sweetheart	.
One	shouldn	't	forsake	a	friend	who	's	died	.
I	'm	not	forsaking	him	.
That	's	more	like	it	.
So	your	old	buddy	held	on	to	this	gun	because	he	was	used	to	it	.
Actually	,	haven	't	these	things	been	out	of	style	for	a	long	time	?
I	'm	no	gun	expert	.
--------------------
That	's	right	.
You	're	more	of	an	expert	on	automobiles	.
What	make	of	car	did	Dr.	Kramm	drive	?
A	"	Hanomag	"	or	a	DKW	?
Who	?
Dr.	Kramm	,	the	guy	you	two	rubbed	out	from	your	car	.
I	don	't	know	what	you	're	talking	about	,	Inspector	.
Is	that	so	?
Müiler	.
It	's	no	good	,	Lilli	.
--------------------
I	can	't	find	a	thing	.
God	almighty	.
There	,	there	.
Steady	,	Lilli	.
My	dear	little	Lilli	.
There	might	be	another	way	.
It	's	a	long	shot	.
What	if	we	flood	the	room	with	water	?
Water	?
Yes	.
--------------------
Where	did	I
What	are	you	looking	for	,	Tom	?
My	knife	.
Water	lessens	the	force	of	an	explosion	.
There	it	is	.
Out	of	the	way	.
It	just	might	break	through	the	wall	for	us	.
What	if	it	doesn	't	,	Tom	?
If	the	water	rises	,	and	we	're
Let	's	try	it	,	Tom	.
--------------------
Here	you	are	,	Inspector	.
Thank	you	.
So	you	don	't	know	anything	about	Dr.	Kramm	's	murder	?
No	,	Inspector	.
The	first	I	heard	of	it	was	right	here	.
Let	me	show	you	something	.
Come	here	.
Come	,	come	.
Take	a	look	at	this	still	life	.
You	're	familiar	with	this	here	.
--------------------
A	7	.	65-	mm	Dreyse	pistol	made	in	1906	.
It	belonged	to	your	friend	.
He	shot	himself	with	it	,	didn	't	he	?
Yes	.
Fine	.
But	do	you	know	what	's	in	there	?
No	.
Well	,	then	,	look	here	.
Take	that	magnifying	glass	and	take	a	careful	look	at	these	two	Easter	eggs	.
Well	?
--------------------
See	any	difference	?
No	,	not	the	slightest	.
You	see	,	my	boy	,	that	's	just	it	!
None	of	us	police	could	detect	any	difference	either	,	neither	with	the	magnifying	glass	nor	in	the	photographs	.
These	two	bullets	are	so	completely	identical	that	they	could	only	have	been	fired	from	the	same	gun	.
Yet	one	was	taken	from	the	skull	of	the	deceased	Dr.	Kramm	,	and	the	other	was	found	in	the	skull	of	your	dead	friend	Hardy	.
Glass	of	water	,	my	lad	?
Cigarette	.
So	now	tell	me	why	your	friend	Hardy	shot	and	killed	Dr.	Kramm	.
I	can	't	tell	you	that	,	Inspector	.
--------------------
Liar	!
Kill	me	if	you	like	,	but	I	don	't	know	what	Hardy	's	orders	were	!
So	you	had	orders	?
Not	me	.
Hardy	.
From	whom	?
I	couldn	't	tell	you	,	Inspector	.
I	've	never	seen	the	man	in	my	life	.
Now	enters	the	mystery	man	.
Come	on	in	and	pull	up	a	chair	.
--------------------
Just	what	we	needed	:	the	man	in	the	shadows	.
So	you	don	't	know	the	man	's	name	?
On	my	honor	,	Inspector	,	I	don	't	know	who	gave	Hardy	those	orders	.
Then	there	's	nothing	we	can	do	.
Dictate	for	the	record	what	you	know	about	the	whole	case	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
Müiler	.
Yes	,	Inspector	.
It	was	like	this	,	Mr.	Assistant	Inspector	.
I	was	just
--------------------
I	was	just	washing	my	car	,	because	everything	has	to	be	in	top	shape	in	these	days	of	keen	competition	.
Suddenly	the	phone	rings	,	and	Hardy	picks	it	up	.
Then	he	came	and	said	we	were	to	catch	up	with	Dr.	Kramm	's	car	at	the	intersection	of	Körnerstrasse	and	Grüner	Winkel	.
So	we	set	out	,	of	course	,	and	pretty	soon	he	showed	up	.
Sergeant	,	take	this	man	away	.
Isn	't	Professor	Baum	's	insane	asylum	on	Grüner	Winkel	?
Yes	,	Inspector	.
So	that	's	where	Dr.	Kramm	spent	his	final	two	hours	.
Look	and	see	if	we	have	any	police	record	for	Dr.	Baum	.
Baum	-	Bertha	,	Anna	,	Ulrich	,	Max	.
--------------------
Nothing	on	him	?
Well	,	that	was	-	Thank	you	.
Get	Professor	Baum	on	the	phone	for	me	.
Professor	,	it	's	police	headquarters	.
Inspector	Lohmann	wishes	to	speak	to	you	.
This	is	Professor	Baum	.
This	man	swears	you	've	been	treating	him	for	the	last	two	months	.
I	think	he	's	just	trying	to	establish	an	alibi	.
I	'd	like	to	confront	him	with	you	.
Without	him	knowing	who	you	are	,	of	course	.
--------------------
Could	you	come	over	right	away	?
Thanks	a	million	,	Professor	.
If	I	'm	on	the	right	track	now	,
I	'm	gonna	get	high	as	a	kite	tonight	!
That	's	our	way	out	!
We	're	saved	!
Inspector	,	when	are	you	going	to	let	me	out	of	this	monkey	cage	?
My	dear	fellow	,	we	're	glad	we	've	got	you	in	there	.
But	I	've	told	you	everything	I	know	.
We	'll	see	about	that	.
--------------------
Professor	,	please	.
Well	,	Professor	,	do	you	know	that	man	?
Is	he	the	one	?
No	,	Inspector	.
I	've	definitely	never	seen	him	before	.
Just	as	I	thought	.
You	there	.
Then	I	've	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Professor	.
Sorry	to	disturb	you	,	Inspector	,	but	we	need	your	signature	here	.
--------------------
I	'll	be	right	with	you	.
Pardon	me	a	moment	,	Professor	.
Perhaps	you	might	wait	in	my	office	.
Room	204	,	at	the	end	of	the	hall	.
Thanks	.
Any	of	you	know	that	man	?
No	,	Inspector	.
No	.
Never	seen	him	before	.
Bredow	,	do	you	know	the	man	you	just	saw	with	me	?
--------------------
No	,	Inspector	.
I	don	't	know	the	gentleman	.
Not	the	slightest	doubt	?
No	.
MURDER	-	2,	000	MARKS	REWARD
Sad	business	,	isn	't	it	?
Especially	for	you	,	since	you	were	a	close	friend	of	the	victim	.
Yes	,	we	were	on	excellent	terms	as	colleagues	.
The	poor	fellow	even	visited	you	on	the	day	of	his	death	.
You	could	have	saved	us	a	lot	of	work	,	Professor	,	if	you	'd	reported	that	to	the	police	.
--------------------
INFORMATlON	OF	ANY	KlND
ESPEClALLY	CONCERNlNG	THE	HOURS	FROM	6	:	00	TO	8	:	00	P.	M.
This	request	was	published	in	every	newspaper	and	posted	on	kiosks	all	over	the	city	.
I	never	read	newspapers	,	only	medical	literature	.
And	today	's	the	first	time	I	've	been	in	town	in	four	weeks	.
Dr.	Kramm	came	to	look	something	up	in	a	scientific	book	in	my	library	.
He	left	in	the	best	of	spirits	.
As	for	his	death	,	it	's	as	much	a	mystery	to	me	as	it	is	to	you	.
Then	I	'm	terribly	sorry	to	have	troubled	you	for	nothing	.
Why	,	it	's	Kent	!
--------------------
Do	you	know	him	?
Who	?
Him	.
I	asked	you	if	you	knew	him	.
Where	would	I	know	him	from	?
I	have	no	idea	,	yet	you	just	spoke	his	name	.
I	did	?
That	was	you	,	Inspector	.
Inspector	,	I	must	speak	to	you	.
It	's	terribly	urgent	.
--------------------
I	suppose	I	may	leave	,	Inspector	?
My	time	is
Of	course	.
By	all	means	,	Professor	.
Just	a	moment	,	Kent	.
Many	thanks	for	coming	.
Don	't	mention	it	.
Good-	bye	.
Good-	bye	.
Inspector	,	please	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
--------------------
Go	on	in	.
It	's	all	right	.
It	's	tremendously	important	-	-	Just	a	moment	.
This	is	crucial	:
Do	you	know	that	man	who	just	left	?
No	.
Are	you	certain	?
I	'm	certain	.
Yet	I	could	swear	he	knew	you	.
Most	certainly	not	.
--------------------
I	've	never	seen	him	before	.
Damn	it	!
What	happened	to	you	,	for	God	's	sake	?
That	's	why	we	've	come	.
And	what	is	the	name	of	this	"	boss	"	you	mention	?
Dr.	Mabuse	.
Goddamn	it	!
Mabuse	again	!
That	fellow	is	dead	!
He	's	alive	and	kicking	,	I	tell	you	.
