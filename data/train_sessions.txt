A	friend	who	's	a	guy	?
I	don	't	know	.
If	they	don	't	meet	alone	.
It	might	be	alright	.
A	guy	can	be	a	friend	.
--------------------
Faith	is	the	key	.
I	don	't	care	whatever	they	do	.
Young	boys	are	okay	.
But	not	older	men	.
The	world	has	changed	.
We	don	't	care	.
No	way	.
I	haven	't	thought	about	it	.
Would	it	matter	?
The	more	,	the	better	.
--------------------
Boyfriends	are	not	lovers	?
Really	?
What	?
Of	course	they	're	not	same	.
CHEATERS
Hello	?
Hi	.
It	's	me	.
Hi	,	-	How	have	you	been	?
Great	,	And	you	?
--------------------
Were	you	asleep	?
Did	I	wake	you	up	?
No	,	I	wasn	't	sleeping	,
Chai-	young	.
Yes	?
I	missed	you	.
Really	?
I	was	out	drinking	,	And	you	came	to	my	mind	.
Then	I	realized	,	I	miss	you	.
Chai-	young	!
--------------------
I	think	...
I	love	you	.
When	a	man	loves	a	woman
Were	you	drunk	last	night	?
No	,	I	meant	what	I	said	.
You	know	I	don	't	get	drunk	.
Then	what	's	the	change	?
Chai-	young	,	let	's	go	steady	.
I	'll	be	good	to	you	.
I	like	you	too	.
--------------------
Really	?
Sure	.
I	always	wanted	to	try	that	.
Isn	't	it	pretty	?
You	're	much	more	prettier	.
What	's	wrong	?
We	're	official	now	.
It	's	alright	.
No	.
It	's	not	alright	.
--------------------
Let	's	take	it	slow	.
Okay	?
Alright	.
Just	a	second	.
Yeah	.
What	is	it	?
Just	a	spam	message	.
What	are	you	doing	tomorrow	?
You	're	off	right	?
How	about	a	short	trip	?
--------------------
Really	?
Are	they	a	new	group	?
I	like	the	music	.
It	's	yours	then	.
Really	?
Yes	.
Aren	't	you	eating	?
Looking	at	you	makes	me	full	.
What	?
This	is	delicious	.
--------------------
Yeah	.
Great	to	see	the	ocean	again	.
How	about	you	?
Me	,	too	.
Wish	I	could	just	live	here	.
I	don	't	want	to	go	home	tonight	.
Really	?
Want	to	stay	here	tonight	?
More	than	welcome	.
Yeah	,	okay	.
--------------------
Bye	.
Who	is	it	?
A	friend	.
A	guy	?
A	friend	from	high	school	.
What	did	your	friend	say	?
Thinks	I	'm	naive	.
I	said	I	'll	be	with	you	tonight	.
And	my	friend	says	I	'm	crazy	.
What	's	so	wrong	about	lovers	being	together	?
--------------------
It	's	nonsense	.
Just	being	a	friend	.
Worrying	about	me	all	the	time	.
You	can	't	change	your	mind	.
Now	that	I	think	about	it	,	I	should	go	home	.
I	think	I	was	drunk	.
What	?
You	can	't	do	that	.
What	a	nosy	weirdo	!
Suk-	ho	!
--------------------
Are	you	still	upset	?
I	'm	not	.
Come	on	.
We	'll	be	together	from	now	on	.
Yeah	,	yeah	.
Sorry	.
Please	don	't	be	mad	.
You	're	scary	when	you	're	mad	.
I	won	't	do	it	again	.
Forget	it	.
--------------------
I	'm	really	sorry	.
Just	this	once	.
Okay	?
Come	on	.
Okay	,	okay	.
Stop	it	.
I	gotta	drive	.
See	ya	.
Bye	.
Hello	?
--------------------
I	called	you	a	dozen	times	.
Didn	't	hear	it	ringing	,
I	was	just	wondering	if	you	got	home	fine	.
I	did	,
You	sound	strange	.
What	were	you	doing	?
Huh	?
Oh	,,,	I	was	working	out	,
Take	it	easy	.
You	must	be	tired	today	.
--------------------
I	'm	done	,	Gonna	take	a	shower	now	,
Chai-	young	...
Yes	?
I	love	you	.
Hello	?
I	've	arrived	.
Come	on	out	.
How	much	longer	?
Alright	.
Thank	you	for	calling	Chai-	young	,
--------------------
Hello	?
What	's	taking	so	long	?
Hurry	up	.
Thank	you	.
Why	?
Something	funny	?
The	name	of	this	place	is	funny	.
What	?
Ramses	?
What	's	so	funny	?
--------------------
It	just	is	.
Silly	.
I	was	grumpy	today	.
How	come	?
Hae-	jin	's	boyfriend	bought	her	new	clothes	.
I	can	buy	you	clothes	too	.
Oh	?
Really	?
Pretty	?
You	look	pretty	in	anything	.
--------------------
Are	you	that	happy	?
I	am	.
You	're	the	best	!
We	have	a	fabulous	event	tonight	.
A	cocktail	show	for	Mr.	Choi	Suk-	ho	and	his	girlfriend	.
Bottoms	up	!
Let	's	toast	.
Huh	?
Yes	.
Cheers	!
--------------------
Thanks	.
Please	enjoy	.
It	's	stronger	than	it	looks	.
Be	careful	.
You	'll	get	drunk	.
Do	you	want	to	go	somewhere	else	?
Oh	!
I	need	to	do	a	report	tonight	.
Oh	,	it	's	nice	.
But	it	's	too	cloudy	.
--------------------
Looks	like	it	'll	rain	.
It	'll	get	better	soon	.
What	happened	?
I	slipped	.
Did	you	get	hurt	?
A	little	.
Feel	better	?
No	.
It	must	be	broken	.
Do	you	like	it	?
--------------------
Yeah	.
You	're	in	as	No	.	1	.
How	's	your	leg	?
Much	better	.
Hop	in	.
Chai-	young	,	the	belt	.
Yup	.
I	like	you	very	very	much	.
You	're	too	good	to	me	.
Oh	yeah	?
--------------------
Yeah	.
Then	do	me	a	favor	.
What	is	it	?
You	'll	do	it	?
Anything	.
Just	say	it	.
I	'll	do	whatever	I	can	.
You	have	to	keep	your	promise	.
What	is	your	wish	?
I	can	't	say	it	now	.
--------------------
But	I	'll	tell	you	later	.
What	is	it	?
Why	can	't	I	see	one	,	when	I	need	it	.
Where	are	we	going	?
Just	taking	a	drive	.
I	'm	tired	.
It	'll	just	be	a	while	.
I	'm	very	tired	too	.
I	'll	doze	off	for	a	second	.
Alright	.
--------------------
Motel	Parking	Lot
What	's	this	?
You	said	...
Crazy	?
Can	't	we	just	lie	down	for	a	while	?
It	's	my	wish	.
What	do	you	think	you	're	doing	?
No	,	I	just	...
Do	I	look	so	cheap	to	you	?
What	are	you	talking	about	?
--------------------
I	'm	really	disappointed	in	you	.
Come	on	.
Get	going	.
Alright	.
Chai-	young	,	I	'm	so	sorry	.
I	just	thought	that	...
Because	you	're	tired	and	your	leg	's	hurt	.
It	won	't	happen	again	.
Then	why	start	it	?
Cause	I	love	you	very	much	.
--------------------
Why	can	't	lovers	be	together	?
Suk-	ho	!
In	broad	day	light	!
Are	you	still	angry	?
I	am	not	.
You	wanna	do	it	that	much	?
What	?
I	know	it	all	.
What	's	the	rush	?
We	have	plenty	of	time	.
--------------------
What	does	it	matter	?
What	if	I	get	pregnant	?
Don	't	worry	about	that	.
How	do	I	not	worry	about	that	?
Mom	said	I	should	be	careful	cause	I	'm	healthy	.
We	can	use	birth	controls	!
I	don	't	know	.
What	if	something	goes	wrong	?
If	that	's	the	case	,	all	the	women	would	be	pregnant	.
Okay	.
--------------------
Next	time	then	.
Always	a	next	time	.
You	're	being	childish	.
What	?
Childish	?
Are	we	going	?
You	're	being	too	much	.
About	what	?
You	started	it	first	.
You	don	't	think	about	me	a	bit	,	do	you	?
--------------------
Making	me	a	fool	.
What	are	you	doing	?
If	you	care	about	me	,	you	can	't	do	this	.
Don	't	you	know	about	my	mind	?
I	love	you	so	much	.
Come	on	.
Do	you	have	any	feelings	for	me	?
Would	I	see	you	if	I	didn	't	?
Chai-	young	,	it	's	me	.
Need	a	lift	home	?
--------------------
Where	are	you	?
Oh	,	you	already	left	?
Okay	then	.
Hey	,	Chai-	young	!
Oh	...	hi	...
Hello	?
Hi	,	It	's	me	,
Oh	Hi	.
How	have	you	been	?
Great	.
--------------------
And	you	?
Were	you	asleep	?
Did	I	wake	you	up	?
No	.
I	wasn	't	sleeping	.
Chai-	young	.
Yes	?
I	missed	you	,	-	Really	?
I	was	out	drinking	.
And	you	came	to	my	mind	.
--------------------
Then	I	realized	,	I	miss	you	.
Chai-	young	.
I	think	...
I	love	you	.
Really	?
I	'll	call	you	later	.
Who	is	it	?
Huh	?
Aren	't	you	gonna	wash	?
I	will	.
--------------------
My	girl	's	boyfriend
Who	was	on	the	phone	?
Nobody	.
Share	the	joke	.
What	's	so	funny	?
None	of	your	business	.
Crazy	asshole	.
New	clothes	?
What	's	up	?
None	of	your	business	.
--------------------
Hey	.
Want	a	piece	of	me	?
How	about	a	round	?
When	are	we	going	to	eat	?
Wait	a	sec	.
Do	you	know	how	many	games	you	played	?
You	're	getting	on	my	nerve	.
Let	's	go	.
I	'm	hungry	.
Help	yourself	,	then	.
--------------------
Men	are	all	like	that	.
They	don	't	know	what	they	did	wrong	.
By	the	way	,	where	's	that	blind-	date	you	promised	?
Just	wait	.
When	?
Soon	.
Why	don	't	we	go	shopping	?
Is	that	a	new	mobile	?
Yeah	.
Neat	,	isn	't	it	?
--------------------
Is	that	the	latest	one
I	guess	so	.
Why	?
What	do	you	care	?
Play	your	computer	game	till	you	drop	dead	.
Hello	?
Oh	,	hi	.
No	,	nothing	.
Now	?
In	front	of	the	library	.
--------------------
Evening	?
Don	't	know	.
Not	much	,	what	about	you	?
Hey	!
Let	's	take	it	slow	.
Okay	?
Alright	.
Just	a	second	.
Yeah	.
What	is	it	?
--------------------
Just	a	spam	message	.
I	'm	in	emergency	situation	,	cancle	the	appoinment	,,,	Sorry	!
What	are	you	doing	tomorrow	?
What	?
You	're	the	one	who	blew	me	off	.
Just	someone	I	know	.
Do	you	think	I	would	cheat	?
Is	that	all	you	can	say	?
Oh	yeah	?
It	's	over	then	!
--------------------
I	don	't	want	to	go	home	tonight	.
Really	?
Want	to	stay	here	tonight	?
More	than	welcome	.
I	'm	not	going	back	.
We	're	through	.
Alright	.
I	'll	think	about	it	.
Are	you	crazy	?
He	's	just	a	friend	.
--------------------
Are	you	tired	?
A	little	.
Just	drop	me	off	in	front	of	the	station	.
Let	me	drive	you	home	.
I	'm	almost	there	,	No	,	you	're	tired	.
Okay	,	okay	.
I	said	I	'm	sorry	.
I	'll	go	get	the	condom	.
We	don	't	need	it	today	.
Really	?
--------------------
What	the	...
Didn	't	hear	it	ringing	.
You	sound	strange	.
I	was	working	out	.
Take	it	easy	,
I	'm	done	.
Gonna	take	a	shower	now	.
Chai-	young	...
Yes	?
I	love	you	.
--------------------
Hand	me	my	underwear	.
Here	you	go	.
Neat	,	yeah	?
You	're	bad	.
I	'm	very	good	to	him	.
He	must	be	nuts	for	you	.
Coming	today	too	?
No	,	not	,	today	.
Let	's	go	shopping	then	.
I	have	plans	.
--------------------
You	're	always	busy	.
It	's	on	you	today	.
Yeah	,	like	always	.
You	're	here	early	.
Good	music	,	yeh	?
Delicious	,	isn	't	it	?
Where	should	we	go	now	?
Where	to	?
Ramses	!
Ramses	!
--------------------
Ramses	?
What	's	so	funny	?
How	do	I	look	?
What	?
Can	't	even	tell	?
New	clothes	?
Like	it	?
You	're	pretty	when	you	're	naked	.
You	're	pretty	in	anything	.
Come	here	.
--------------------
I	'll	take	it	off	.
No	,	you	'll	wrinkle	the	clothes	.
Hold	still	.
Hey	,	don	't	.
Hey	!
She	's	hot	.
You	got	lucky	,	man	.
Enough	.
How	old	is	she	?
Twenty	one	?
--------------------
Two	?
She	's	practically	a	minor	.
You	can	say	that	.
When	did	you	meet	her	?
Six	months	ago	?
We	've	been	dating	only	recently	.
And	you	didn	't	do	her	yet	?
It	's	not	like	you	.
I	was	busy	then	.
Really	.
--------------------
How	did	you	meet	?
You	need	to	know	everything	?
Come	on	.
Give	me	the	goods	.
Alright	.
You	persistent	prick	.
I	was	out	drinking	with	friends	.
And	she	was	a	waitress	there	,	She	lit	up	the	room	,
Oh	,	my	!
We	met	for	a	quick	round	of	drinks	,	but	all	the	guys	went	wild	,
--------------------
Ordering	on	and	on	,
Have	fun	.
When	other	guys	were	just	drooling	,
I	started	my	move	,
Let	me	help	.
It	's	alright	.
No	,	I	insist	.
It	's	too	heavy	to	take	.
Thank	you	.
You	're	beautiful	.
--------------------
So	I	kept	calling	her	,
And	now	seeing	her	.
What	did	you	say	to	her	?
Just	that	she	's	pretty	.
The	brave	wins	the	beauty	.
Beauty	makes	the	brave	.
Chai-	young	,	need	a	lift	?
Where	are	you	?
Me	?
I	'm	in	the	subway	.
--------------------
Yeah	...
The	subway	?
Who	is	it	?
Just	somebody	I	know	.
Somebody	who	?
You	know	,	at	my	part-	time	job	.
Bored	?
I	'll	be	over	soon	.
The	card	.
When	did	you	see	?
--------------------
You	like	being	popular	?
I	'm	just	being	polite	to	the	customer	.
Then	how	did	he	get	your	number	?
Beats	me	.
Choi	Suk-	ho
Don	't	answer	his	calls	.
I	wasn	't	going	to	anyway	.
Got	a	new	cellphone	?
Isn	't	it	neat	?
See	ya	.
--------------------
Hey	,	Chai-	young	!
Of	all	the	places	...
Of	all	the	places	?
You	think	I	'm	stupid	?
He	's	just	a	friend	who	gave	me	a	lift	.
What	about	the	subway	?
Why	did	you	lie	?
I	met	him	on	my	way	to	the	subway	station	.
Then	call	him	up	.
What	call	.
--------------------
To	ask	him	if	you	guys	are	really	just	friends	.
You	don	't	believe	me	?
He	's	just	a	friend	.
Men	can	never	be	friends	.
Okay	.
I	won	't	see	him	.
Don	't	even	call	him	.
I	'm	scared	.
Don	't	be	afraid	.
Do	you	love	me	?
--------------------
Of	course	.
It	's	my	first	time	,	will	it	hurt	?
I	'll	be	gentle	.
Wait	,	wait	.
What	?
What	's	wrong	?
Wait	.
Are	you	alright	?
I	think	so	.
Try	to	relax	.
--------------------
I	'll	take	it	slow	.
Hold	on	.
Ouch	!
What	now	?
The	condom	.
I	got	this	from	Japan	,	0	.	03mm	.
It	's	like	ultra	thin	.
Mine	now	.
Give	it	back	.
It	's	the	only	one	,	asshole	.
--------------------
You	have	no	where	to	use	it	anyway	.
I	do	!
I	'm	going	to	.
Just	use	the	regular	stuff	then	.
My	girl	's	boyfriend	's	girlfriend
Hey	,	long	time	no	see	.
Were	you	drunk	?
Not	much	.
Then	what	got	into	you	?
Nothing	.
--------------------
I	've	been	busy	.
It	's	been	a	while	.
Do	you	remember	the	first	time	we	were	here	?
Wanna	go	for	a	ride	?
How	's	that	?
Wow	.
You	've	improved	.
Want	it	tighter	?
Of	course	.
I	want	to	do	it	from	behind	.
--------------------
Okay	.
Don	't	even	dream	of	it	.
I	was	just	playing	around	.
Why	are	you	not	married	?
Don	't	know	.
I	'm	hungry	.
What	do	you	want	?
Buy	me	sushi	.
Try	some	.
It	's	good	.
--------------------
You	know	I	don	't	like	this	.
Oh	,	didn	't	you	?
You	eat	all	you	want	.
Should	have	gone	somewhere	else	.
You	came	to	my	mind	.
I	miss	you	.
Chai-	young	.
What	are	you	doing	here	?
Okay	.
Okay	bye	.
--------------------
Disappearing	suddenly	...
Ji-	yon	.
You	stink	.
Wanna	see	a	movie	tomorrow	?
Tomorrow	?
I	have	plans	.
Let	's	go	.
Just	meet	him	once	.
No	way	.
Remember	him	from	the	exhibition	?
--------------------
He	fell	for	you	then	.
What	does	he	do	?
He	's	a	friend	of	Taek-	su	,	a	producer	.
Are	you	still	seeing	him	?
Who	?
Taek-	su	?
Yes	.
You	know	.
What	are	you	doing	with	a	married	man	?
Just	enjoying	myself	.
--------------------
I	feel	sorry	for	your	boyfriend	.
You	're	being	rustic	.
Boyfriends	are	boyfriends	,	and	lovers	are	lovers	.
Married	men	are	so	convenient	.
They	buy	you	dinner	,	drinks	,	and	even	expensive	gifts	.
And	don	't	drag	you	around	.
You	're	going	with	me	,	okay	?
Let	's	just	go	for	a	drive	instead	.
I	've	already	made	all	the	arrangements	.
Over	here	.
--------------------
Remember	Min-	chul	?
Hello	.
Hi	.
He	's	a	friend	of	Min-	chul	.
Are	you	okay	?
Get	up	,	up	.
You	're	a	good	dancer	.
I	'm	good	at	other	things	too	.
Your	boobs	are	awesome	.
Just	keep	going	.
--------------------
You	blew	me	off	,
I	had	good	reasons	to	.
What	's	between	you	guys	?
He	's	just	a	friend	.
Do	you	think	I	would	cheat	?
You	're	good	at	it	.
Is	that	all	you	can	say	?
I	really	regret	seeing	you	again	.
Yeah	?
Call	it	quits	then	.
--------------------
I	'm	through	with	you	,	-	Hello	?
Hey	!
You	're	quite	good	.
Have	you	been	working	out	?
You	look	good	on	camera	.
Really	?
You	're	quite	photogenic	.
Very	impressive	.
Ready	for	a	challenge	?
Aren	't	you	tired	?
--------------------
Let	's	take	a	break	.
Alright	.
I	'll	think	about	it	.
What	does	he	do	?
Who	?
You	sure	you	're	not	cheating	?
Are	you	crazy	?
He	's	just	a	friend	.
Hello	?
It	's	me	,
--------------------
What	's	up	?
Nothing	much	.
I	'm	a	little	busy	with	work	.
Can	you	stop	by	later	?
Sorry	.
I	have	a	dinner	appointment	.
What	appointment	.
Big	clients	from	Japan	.
Let	's	go	.
We	'll	be	late	.
--------------------
Take	it	easy	.
You	must	be	tired	today	.
I	'm	done	.
Gonna	take	a	shower	now	.
Chai-	young	...
I	love	you	.
Hello	?
Chai-	young	?
What	the	...
There	's	an	empty	slot	in	the	back	.
--------------------
I	'll	be	down	in	a	sec	.
Okay	.
What	are	you	doing	?
You	're	so	cute	sleeping	.
You	know	I	hate	pictures	.
Stop	shooting	!
I	'm	sorry	.
I	didn	't	get	much	sleep	so	I	got	up	late	.
You	really	didn	't	get	my	message	?
That	's	strange	.
--------------------
Sorry	,	and	I	love	you	!
Suk-	ho
What	's	taking	her	so	long	.
Oh	hi	,	Ji-	yon	.
You	wanna	catch	a	movie	later	?
I	'm	a	little	busy	.
You	can	't	?
Yeah	,	some	other	time	.
What	?
Suk-	ho	,	I	have	a	question	.
--------------------
I	'm	a	little	busy	,	what	?
You	know	,
Is	there	any	secret	to	look	good	to	a	woman	?
For	what	?
You	're	an	expert	on	this	.
For	free	?
I	'll	buy	you	a	box	of	those	0	.	03mm	condoms	you	like	from	Japan	.
You	gotta	be	kidding	.
Okay	,	then	.
I	'll	lend	you	my	DMB	for	a	month	.
--------------------
Don	't	need	it	.
Alright	,	alright	.
It	's	yours	,	you	asshole	.
You	promise	?
I	'll	give	it	to	you	.
Now	talk	,	-	To	look	good	to	a	woman	.
Girls	like	it	when	men	are	focused	on	something	.
Try	resting	your	chin	on	your	hand	when	you	drive	,
Or	when	you	need	to	make	an	emergency	stop	.
Hold	her	from	sliding	,
--------------------
Thank	you	.
Don	't	lose	that	moment	,
Little	conservative	but	,	the	sweat	and	the	biceps	.
Might	not	useful	for	you	,	but	the	wet	hair	after	a	shower	can	be	quite	sexy	,
Ah	,	this	one	I	used	a	while	ago	.
Drive	backwards	with	one	hand	,
You	're	a	good	driver	.
Girls	really	dig	that	?
Not	all	the	girls	.
It	depends	...
--------------------
By	the	way	,	who	is	it	this	time	?
None	of	your	business	.
You	're	early	today	.
It	's	cheesecake	.
Why	don	't	we	make	a	sister	for	Ye-	ji	?
Son	of	a	...
Stop	boy	,	stop	.
Up	!
Put	your	feet	up	!
Up	!
--------------------
Insolent	piece	of	shit	!
Put	your	feet	up	!
How	dare	you	.
Son	of	a	...
Put	your	feet	up	!
Where	did	we	get	you	anyway	.
Who	's	the	worst	woman	in	the	world	?
Who	?
Bitch	who	doesn	't	give	any	.
But	the	worse	is	?
--------------------
What	?
Bitch	giving	not	just	me	but	everyone	.
That	's	your	story	.
And	there	's	one	more	.
Can	't	remember	though	...
Our	girl	's	boyfriend
Let	's	just	go	for	a	drive	.
I	've	already	made	all	the	arrangements	.
You	have	to	be	there	.
Okay	.
--------------------
If	he	's	not	...
Don	't	worry	.
Thanks	.
You	're	a	gal	.
You	owe	me	one	.
Of	course	.
I	owe	you	one	.
Okay	.
Good	luck	.
Thanks	.
--------------------
See	you	later	.
Oh	,	you	're	early	.
How	've	you	been	?
Here	.
Do	me	a	favor	.
Is	this	it	?
Ah	,	sorry	about	that	.
It	's	alright	.
I	'll	listen	to	it	.
When	's	the	release	?
--------------------
About	next	month	.
I	see	.
These	kids	can	really	sing	.
Please	,	do	me	a	favor	.
It	's	not	my	call	.
This	has	to	work	.
How	about	dinner	...
Maybe	next	time	.
I	'm	almost	there	.
Hey	!
--------------------
What	the	!
It	's	an	honor	to	see	you	again	.
Perhaps	it	's	fate	.
I	heard	a	lot	about	you	.
Oh	,	about	?
You	work	in	the	TV	station	.
Yes	,	yes	.
You	must	be	busy	.
Not	really	,	maybe	a	little	.
Have	you	ordered	yet	?
--------------------
Where	's	the	...
The	menu	please	.
Here	.
Oh	,	this	tiny	thing	.
It	's	okay	.
Choose	your	favorite	.
The	flowers	are	withering	.
Two	orange	juice	.
Orange	juice	,	good	for	skin	.
Smoothie	?
--------------------
What	's	a	smoothie	?
He	must	have	been	nervous	.
He	babbles	when	he	's	nervous	.
Way	too	nervous	.
Wanna	go	clubbing	instead	?
It	's	on	me	.
Nah
Come	on	.
I	don	't	know	.
Hey	...
--------------------
Sorry	,	we	have	to	go	.
Why	?
We	need	to	see	some	people	for	her	exhibition	coming	up	.
Well	,	if	that	's	the	case	.
What	's	wrong	with	you	?
I	was	just	thinking	.
Hand	me	the	CD	.
The	one	inside	.
I	'll	give	it	to	you	later	.
Pay	more	attention	to	Ye-	ji	.
--------------------
I	will	.
Hello	?
Chai-	young	?
I	'm	almost	there	,
Sit	over	here	.
Beside	a	married	woman	?
No	.
What	would	you	like	?
Coffee	,	please	.
This	place	hasn	't	changed	.
--------------------
Yeah	.
Remember	this	song	?
It	must	be	a	remake	.
Remember	when	we	first	heard	this	song	?
That	raining	night	,	we	were	soaking	wet	.
Why	bring	that	up	?
Those	were	the	days	.
Do	you	want	to	go	somewhere	?
Somewhere	?
Get	a	grip	.
--------------------
What	's	wrong	?
You	don	't	look	well	.
Nothing	.
What	do	women	like	?
Why	?
That	's	so	strange	.
Ah	,	alright	.
Okay	.
I	'll	be	there	.
Yeah	.
--------------------
Yes	,	I	found	it	.
Hello	?
Wanna	catch	a	movie	later	?
You	can	't	?
Hello	?
Who	?
Surprised	?
How	did	you	find	...
I	dropped	by	for	coffee	.
Here	.
--------------------
Ah	...	thanks	.
Am	I	intruding	?
No	...
Wow	.
Nice	place	.
You	have	good	taste	.
Do	you	have	coffee	?
Please	have	a	seat	.
Yes	.
Hello	?
--------------------
I	'll	be	right	there	.
I	need	to	move	my	car	.
Need	help	?
No	thanks	.
I	'll	wait	here	then	.
Girls	really	dig	that	?
Not	all	the	girls	,	It	depends	,
Who	are	you	seeing	this	time	?
None	of	your	business	,
How	come	married	men	are	more	popular	?
--------------------
Oh	I	got	it	.
Thanks	.
Sorry	,	it	took	so	long	.
Nah	.
Thank	you	.
It	's	hot	.
Ah	,	it	's	hot	.
You	shoot	nude	pictures	?
It	's	for	my	collection	.
I	can	be	a	model	too	.
--------------------
Something	's	on	your	...
What	?
On	your	shoulder	...
Have	you	...
Have	you	...
Have	you	eaten	?
Girls	like	it	when	men	are	focused	on	something	,
Try	resting	your	chin	on	your	hand	when	you	drive	,
Or	when	make	an	emergency	stop	.
Hold	her	from	sliding	,
--------------------
Don	't	lose	that	moment	,
It	's	a	flat	tire	.
Someting	's	stuck	in	the	tire	?
It	looks	alright	.
Should	never	leave	it	like	that	.
Little	conservative	but	,	the	sweat	after	a	work-	out	,	or	the	biceps	...
These	are	the	basics	,
Might	not	useful	for	you	,	but	the	wet	hair	after	a	shower	can	be	quite	sexy	,
Wait	.
Let	me	check	first	.
--------------------
Drive	backwards	with	one	hand	,
She	went	crazy	,
Mister	,	do	you	have	a	light	?
You	young	prick	,
Hey	!
Go	back	to	school	.
Get	lost	.
Is	that	a	grin	?
What	's	the	matter	?
This	asshole	's	hitting	me	.
--------------------
Do	we	look	funny	to	you	?
What	the	fuck	.
What	did	you	say	?
No	.
Wait	a	sec	.
Don	't	...	don	't	...
Keep	mumbling	,	you	shit	.
You	little	shit	.
Say	it	again	,	you	shit	.
Say	it	again	,	asshole	.
--------------------
Don	't	smoke	in	public	!
The	brave	wins	the	beauty	.
Beauty	makes	the	brave	.
That	makes	sense	.
I	should	use	it	sometime	.
Hello	?
Of	course	.
I	can	make	time	for	you	.
Who	is	it	?
None	of	your	business	.
--------------------
And	the	worst	woman	of	all	.
Can	you	guess	?
What	is	it	?
Bitch	who	gives	everyone	but	not	me	.
Hello	?
Where	are	you	?
See	the	convenient	store	?
Walk	straight	till	you	see	...
Over	here	.
The	Friends
--------------------
I	wouldn	't	recognize	you	if	I	see	you	on	the	streets	.
The	last	time	I	saw	you	,	you	were	in	junior	high	.
I	was	at	your	wedding	.
Sorry	,	were	you	there	?
I	was	too	busy	then	.
Stop	being	so	friendly	.
How	can	you	guys	be	real	brothers	.
Stop	the	nonsense	.
Drink	up	.
Do	you	have	a	girlfriend	?
--------------------
No	,	I	don	't
Want	me	to	set	you	up	?
Hey	,	I	'm	more	desperate	here	.
Crazy	shit	.
You	'll	ruin	my	reputation	.
Look	at	you	talking	,	you	rude	prick	.
Then	get	your	act	straight	.
What	did	I	do	wrong	?
Think	hard	,	man	.
This	is	outrageous	.
--------------------
Here	.
I	caught	him	dating	my	girl	once	.
Before	you	got	married	?
No	,	not	long	ago	.
She	liked	me	more	.
Like	my	ass	.
Huh	?
I	was	good	to	her	.
Taking	her	home	everyday	.
She	must	have	felt	sorry	for	you	.
--------------------
Call	her	then	.
Ask	her	.
I	was	out	drinking	.
And	you	came	to	my	mind	.
Then	I	realized	,	I	miss	you	.
Suk-	ho	,	let	's	go	.
Ji-	yon	,	can	you	come	out	?
Get	up	,	let	's	go	.
That	little	...
I	'm	sorry	.
--------------------
I	'm	out	drinking	with	my	brother	.
You	don	't	believe	me	?
Let	's	get	going	!
I	'm	sorry	.
No	,	it	's	alright	.
Then	see	you	next	time	.
Sorry	,	I	'll	call	you	.
Yeah	...
Have	a	good	day	.
Hello	?
--------------------
Oh	hi	.
Is	this	good	?
You	might	like	it	.
So	,	what	's	wrong	?
Ye-	ji	wants	to	ride	the	ferry	.
What	about	Suk-	ho	?
Don	't	know	.
He	's	too	busy	.
Do	I	have	to	?
Wait	.
--------------------
Hold	on	.
Wow	.
What	's	this	?
What	's	it	for	?
I	missed	your	last	birthday	.
It	must	be	very	expensive	.
Hope	you	like	it	.
What	's	this	mess	.
It	doesn	't	get	off	.
New	clothes	?
--------------------
I	had	a	blind-	date	today	.
How	did	it	go	?
Nothing	's	easy	.
What	do	I	remove	this	with	?
What	's	the	smile	about	?
No	,	nothing	.
Greet	your	master	for	once	.
You	son	of	a	...
Come	home	early	.
The	dog	can	't	even	recognize	you	.
--------------------
Where	's	Ye-	ji	?
Over	at	Mom	's	place	.
Change	and	wash	up	.
Chai-	young	,	it	's	me	.
Need	a	lift	?
Where	are	you	?
Oh	,	you	already	left	?
Alright	.
What	are	you	looking	for	?
Have	you	seen	my	watch	?
--------------------
Oh	,	that	fake	?
It	's	real	,	you	prick	.
Lost	it	already	?
Where	the	hell	...
It	didn	't	suit	you	anyway	.
Come	on	.
Be	careful	.
Oh	,	I	remember	.
I	've	been	looking	all	over	for	it	.
I	'll	call	you	back	.
--------------------
Found	it	?
Okay	,
I	'll	go	fetch	it	.
Stupid	.
Stupid	.
See	ya	.
Hey	,	Chai-	young	!
Oh	...	hi	...
Pull	yourself	together	.
Thank	god	.
--------------------
I	thought	I	lost	it	.
Don	't	you	dare	lose	it	.
Okay	.
Hello	?
Hi	.
Are	you	busy	?
Why	?
Cause	I	miss	you	.
Sorry	,	but	he	's	just	a	friend	.
Do	you	even	care	about	me	?
--------------------
Wanna	come	over	?
Yes	,	sir	!
I	have	to	go	.
Already	?
You	don	't	care	about	me	.
I	don	't	understand	you	.
What	should	I	do	then	?
Something	came	up	today	.
I	won	't	be	going	home	.
Don	't	wait	up	.
--------------------
I	see	.
Don	't	answer	the	phone	.
Not	inside	.
Where	's	that	condom	from	Japan	?
You	know	,	0	.	03mm	.
None	left	.
I	'll	just	cum	outside	.
Your	husband	took	the	last	one	.
Okay	now	?
Yes	.
--------------------
It	might	hurt	a	little	.
First	time	's	always	like	that	.
I	'm	cumming	.
No	,	not	yet	.
You	're	so	horny	.
Do	you	have	a	boyfriend	?
You	can	be	one	.
Can	I	cum	inside	?
Whatever	you	want	.
Wait	,	wait	!
--------------------
What	now	?
I	can	't	do	it	.
Come	on	.
Can	we	do	it	next	time	?
You	said	we	'd	just	lie	down	.
That	's	...
Do	you	love	me	?
Of	course	.
Give	me	more	time	.
I	can	't	do	it	today	.
--------------------
I	'm	sorry	.
You	're	really	...
Then	do	it	with	your	mouth	.
My	mouth	?
A	week	later	,,,
Why	don	't	we	,	go	shopping	after	dinner	?
If	you	want	.
Great	.
Yes	,	let	's	go	shopping	...
Hey	,	how	are	you	?
--------------------
What	brings	you	here	?
To	have	dinner	of	course	.
How	have	you	been	?
Wow	.
You	look	good	.
This	is	my	wife	.
Hello	.
Nice	to	meet	you	.
Is	she	your	daughter	?
She	's	pretty	.
--------------------
How	are	you	doing	?
As	usual	.
I	'm	with	a	new	company	.
Yeah	?
Call	me	sometime	.
You	're	on	the	fast	lane	.
I	try	.
Hey	,	you	still	into	woman	?
Drink	up	.
Do	you	remember	Sung-	hwan	?
--------------------
The	one	who	married	Eun-	jung	.
He	works	at	a	musical	company	.
Gave	me	expensive	tickets	to	his	show	.
Alright	.
Let	me	know	then	.
What	does	he	say	?
He	's	always	nuts	for	free	stuff	.
Do	you	have	time	this	week	?
I	wanted	to	see	that	show	.
Yeah	,	thanks	to	my	friend	.
--------------------
It	's	me	,	your	brother	.
Really	?
Count	me	in	.
Thanks	,	bro	.
Hey	,	wait	up	.
Hurry	up	then	.
I	'm	good	,	eh	?
You	've	improved	.
What	's	the	call	about	?
You	wanted	to	see	a	musical	,	right	?
--------------------
A	musical	?
Hey	,	Young-	soo	.
Why	are	you	always	late	.
Here	.
This	is	my	girlfriend	.
And	this	is	Suk-	ho	's	wife	.
You	are	married	?
Hello	?
And	my	brother	.
Where	is	your	girlfriend	?
--------------------
Hello	,	I	'm	Sun-	soo	's	brother	.
Oh	,	hello	.
You	're	very	pretty	.
Have	we	met	before	?
She	's	hot	.
I	don	't	know	.
Let	's	get	inside	.
Let	's	go	.
Hey	!
That	's	right	!
--------------------
10	minutes	recess	,,,
Why	is	this	musical	so	long	?
What	the	hell	is	the	second	part	?
What	's	wrong	?
It	's	just	a	headache	.
I	was	bored	too	.
It	won	't	be	worth	it	.
Ladies	and	gentlemen	,	please	resume	your	seats	,,,
Thank	you	,
What	's	happening	?
--------------------
Did	we	stop	?
Did	we	stop	?
Hello	?
It	's	not	working	?
The	button	doesn	't	work	.
Are	we	trapped	?
Hello	?
What	the	...
Shit	.
What	should	we	do	?
--------------------
Just	wait	.
I	need	a	drink	.
Is	it	good	?
Play	this	for	me	.
Where	did	you	...
Would	men	accept	your	friend	who	is	a	guy	?
Would	it	matter	?
The	more	the	better	.
Boyfriends	are	not	lovers	.
What	?
--------------------
Really	?
Of	course	they	're	not	same	.
Hey	!
What	the	!
No	way	.
Where	to	?
Haven	't	thought	about	it	.
Ramses	!
Ramses	!
Thank	you	.
--------------------
Would	you	do	an	interview	?
The	world	has	changed	.
We	don	't	care	.
Thank	you	.
Are	you	OK	?
It	's	nothing	.
Young	boys	are	okay	.
But	older	men	can	't	be	trusted	.
Thank	you	.
Sorry	to	be	late	.
--------------------
Let	's	go	.
Thank	you	.
That	was	my	cousin	.
She	loves	the	place	.
Would	you	like	to	be	a	model	?
I	don	't	care	whatever	they	do	.
He	got	dumped	yesterday	.
Thank	you	.
What	's	taking	so	long	?
Suk-	ho	,	Wanna	get	married	?
--------------------
A	guy	can	be	a	friend	.
Faith	is	the	key	.
If	she	doesn	't	lie	,	I	can	accept	it	.
He	doesn	't	have	a	girlfriend	.
Crazy	assholes	.
No	,	don	't	...
If	they	don	't	meet	alone	,
I	can	understand	.
I	don	't	believe	you	.
Thank	you	.
--------------------
Was	it	good	?
Really	?
Sometimes	,	she	seems	like	my	own	daughter	.
Honey	,	what	's	this	?
What	time	is	it	?
Where	's	my	watch	?
Downloaded	From	www	.	AllSubs	.	org
The	change	in	the	last	paragraph	is	:
"	ln	the	hope	that	the	Ministry	of	Culture	's	commitment	...
"	set	at	812,	000	francs	...	"	will	not	be	altered	...	"
--------------------
City	Hall	?
Public	works	,	please	.
MY	GlRLFRlEND	'S	BOYFRlEND
"	My	friends	'	friends	are	my	friends	.	"
May	I	sit	here	?
Of	course	.
I	know	there	're	other	tables	,	but	when	I	'm	alone	,	the	guys	always	bug	me	.
You	're	safe	with	me	!
You	work	here	?
No	,	I	got	an	entry	pass	,	and	I	feel	a	bit	awkward	...
--------------------
Forget	it	,	I	'll	sit	there	.
No	,	stay	!
I	hate	to	eat	alone	!
So	do	I	,	but	I	don	't	always	want	to	see	the	same	faces	.
I	change	restaurants	every	day	...
I	know	them	all	around	here	.
At	noon	,	I	don	't	eat	much	.
Me	neither	,	usually	.
This	morning	I	had	an	errand	and	had	to	skip	breakfast	.
So	...
--------------------
You	a	student	?
I	work	at	City	Hall	.
Cultural	Affairs	.
I	'm	still	in	computer	school	.
Know	where	it	is	?
The	one	nearby	?
I	'm	a	senior	...
One	more	month	and	my	carefree	days	are	over	!
My	nomad	days	,	that	is	.
Except	in	class	.
--------------------
I	'm	always	on	the	move	.
Me	too	...
I	get	around	a	lot	.
You	live	where	?
The	Belvedere	,	at	St.	Christophe	.
That	huge	place	?
We	're	neighbours	.
I	'm	at	the	Lozere	.
ln	Cergy	Village	?
That	's	it	!
--------------------
I	don	't	really	live	there	.
It	's	just	my	address	.
You	like	where	you	are	?
Very	much	.
To	me	it	's	a	barracks	.
I	'd	call	it	a	palace	.
From	outside	,	maybe	,	but	...	inside	?
Ever	been	?
No	,	but	I	can	imagine	it	.
You	're	more	independent	than	in	a	lot	of	small	buildings	.
--------------------
I	sound	like	a	brochure	.
But	it	feels	like	being	in	a	luxury	hotel	.
Sure	,	if	you	don	't	stay	too	long	...
Anyway	,	I	'm	sort	of	a	transient	.
I	live	with	a	friend	.
My	boyfriend	.
Home	's	really	at	my	folks	'	,	in	St.	Germain	.
I	sleep	there	some	weekends	.
I	used	to	take	Fabien	with	me	,	but	...	he	doesn	't	like	it	there	.
Yet	my	folks	like	him	.
--------------------
He	does	sports	on	weekends	.
Forget	it	!
Especially	water	sports	.
I	hate	the	water	!
Do	you	...	have	a	lover	?
Not	for	the	moment	.
Not	here	,	not	in	Paris	,	not	back	home	.
I	'm	from	the	sticks	.
But	you	have	had	?
Of	course	!
--------------------
But	just	now	,	it	's	a	total	blank	.
I	've	no	man	in	my	life	.
You	're	right	.
You	've	got	plenty	of	time	.
You	have	friends	,	no	?
Not	really	.
It	's	the	only	thing	I	really	lack	here	.
I	'm	in	no	rush	for	a	lover	.
I	have	to	get	back	.
I	set	my	own	schedule	.
--------------------
I	have	a	dream	job	.
No	one	above	me	or	under	me	,	really	.
No	direct	superior	,	no	private	secretary	,	either	.
But	I	have	to	get	my	work	done	.
Sometimes	I	work	through	lunch	...	but	it	's	healthier	to	take	a	break	.
You	say	you	hate	the	water	?
For	drinking	?
Oh	,	swimming	!
No	,	I	'm	scared	of	the	water	.
Never	go	to	the	pool	?
--------------------
God	,	no	!
It	's	not	dangerous	.
I	know	,	but	the	chlorine	,	the	crowds	...	ugh	!
And	I	nearly	drowned	once	.
You	can	't	swim	?
I	can	...	badly	.
lf	you	could	swim	,	your	fear	would	vanish	.
Starting	's	the	problem	.
I	'd	like	to	.
Fabien	spends	half	his	life	in	the	water	.
--------------------
Can	't	he	teach	you	?
I	won	't	let	him	.
Maybe	someone	with	more	authority	could	...
He	's	not	that	way	.
I	often	go	to	the	pool	at	noon	,	instead	of	lunching	.
Not	many	people	,	it	's	restful	...
The	gates	to	the	park	are	open	now	,	you	can	lie	in	the	sun	...
I	'm	a	good	teacher	.
I	could	gently	teach	you	to	vanquish	your	fear	.
Want	to	try	?
--------------------
Love	to	.
For	some	reason	,	I	trust	you	.
But	it	'll	bore	you	silly	.
No	it	won	't	.
I	think	it	's	fun	.
By	vacation	time	you	'll	swim	life	a	fish	!
Go	on	,	I	'm	holding	you	.
Don	't	let	go	!
Hang	on	!
Sure	...	now	relax	!
--------------------
Breathe	out	...
Blow	into	the	water	...
Open	your	mouth	...
Again	...
Take	it	easy	!
That	's	it	!
Keep	it	up	!
I	'll	...	swallow	it	!
Don	't	be	afraid	.
I	've	got	you	!
--------------------
Relax	...
Easy	does	it	.
Alexandre	!
Blanche	,	this	is	Alexandre	.
Been	here	long	?
Just	got	here	.
We	're	leaving	.
Catch	you	next	time	.
Come	here	often	?
No	.
--------------------
You	?
Seldom	.
Who	was	that	fellow	?
A	friend	of	Fabien	.
Power	and	Light	engineer	.
Gorgeous	Alexandre	.
He	is	handsome	.
He	interest	you	?
He	's	...	noticeable	.
I	've	seen	him	around	.
--------------------
All	the	girls	ogle	him	,	but	he	doesn	't	turn	me	on	.
I	don	't	think	he	's	your	type	.
Why	say	that	?
You	don	't	know	me	.
Well	enough	to	know	you	're	no	girl	for	him	.
I	'm	not	cute	enough	?
That	's	not	it	at	all	!
You	're	much	better-	looking	than	the	chicks	he	usually	dates	.
He	doesn	't	choose	.
He	grabs	what	he	finds	.
--------------------
He	waits	for	the	girl	to	make	a	move	.
Since	I	wait	for	the	man	to	move	,	we	'll	never	team	up	.
Come	in	.
Hi	.
Did	you	find	it	easily	?
Sure	.
Right	with	you	.
You	OK	?
Fine	.
And	you	?
--------------------
Fabien	...
Blanche	,	my	swim	teacher	.
A	bad	teacher	.
I	pushed	you	too	hard	the	other	day	.
You	were	very	gentle	.
I	felt	no	strain	.
It	's	always	like	that	at	first	.
You	get	tense	.
Stop	!
You	're	not	my	teacher	.
--------------------
Where	'll	we	meet	?
Who	,	me	?
Going	to	the	pool	?
No	.
She	's	not	either	.
I	'm	helping	her	on	an	errand	.
I	didn	't	plan	to	come	back	here	.
We	'll	be	late	.
I	must	go	to	Pontoise	,	then	we	're	off	to	that	party	in	Paris	.
Want	me	to	go	with	you	?
--------------------
What	do	I	do	while	you	confer	?
He	's	taking	an	amp	to	be	fixed	.
That	takes	hours	!
I	'll	be	a	second	.
You	'll	learn	something	.
I	learn	by	day	.
At	night	I	rest	!
I	don	't	mind	coming	back	to	get	you	,	but	it	'll	take	at	least	half	an	hour	!
He	's	right	.
Go	with	him	.
--------------------
I	hate	to	ditch	you	.
You	're	not	.
I	'll	see	you	Monday	.
OK	.
See	you	Monday	.
Sorry	.
Not	to	worry	.
'Bye	.
She	's	sweet	.
ln	her	place	I	'd	be	furious	!
--------------------
Why	?
I	said	I	'd	go	to	the	pool	and	I	didn	't	.
She	asked	me	to	help	with	an	errand	,	and	I	didn	't	.
It	's	not	your	fault	.
She	was	just	being	nice	.
Who	knows	if	she	wanted	you	around	?
Mind	your	own	business	.
You	don	't	know	her	.
She	's	a	sensitive	,	thoughtful	girl	.
We	were	horribly	rude	to	her	!
--------------------
She	was	tactful	.
She	saw	we	were	in	a	hurry	.
And	so	we	are	!
So	let	's	move	it	!
Coming	?
What	are	you	doing	?
What	's	the	rush	if	I	'm	going	with	you	?
I	'd	like	to	be	early	.
You	never	know	.
Must	we	go	?
--------------------
You	never	said	you	didn	't	want	to	go	.
It	's	too	late	now	.
And	I	hate	to	cancel	dates	.
They	like	you	more	than	me	.
You	go	alone	.
Tell	them	I	'm	sick	,	which	is	true	!
You	don	't	feel	good	?
You	sick	?
No	,	but	I	'm	stiff	.
I	ache	all	over	.
--------------------
I	'd	better	rest	.
Really	?
Really	.
I	'd	better	take	you	home	.
Don	't	bother	.
I	'll	go	to	Mom	's	.
She	'll	take	care	of	me	.
Call	you	tomorrow	.
Monday	I	'll	be	back	,	fresh	as	a	daisy	.
Lea	?
--------------------
How	are	you	?
Fine	,	thanks	.
Apologize	for	what	?
You	didn	't	ditch	me	.
What	?
lf	I	'd	known	...
Sorry	!
No	,	you	really	spared	me	a	chore	.
I	did	want	to	rest	.
I	'm	limber	again	,	ready	to	swim	for	miles	!
--------------------
Don	't	take	that	literally	!
No	,	how	about	tomorrow	?
Let	's	have	dinner	together	.
I	don	't	drag	him	with	me	everywhere	.
I	want	to	talk	to	you	.
For	your	ears	only	.
Then	come	to	my	place	for	dinner	.
Like	it	?
It	's	very	pretty	.
They	will	put	some	grass	in	,	no	?
--------------------
It	'll	grow	.
The	view	's	different	from	here	.
You	can	see	the	lakes	!
Lovely	!
You	can	see	the	Defense	,	and	all	the	way	to	the	Eiffel	Tower	.
Got	any	binoculars	?
Binoculars	?
So	I	could	watch	Fabien	when	he	windsurfs	.
He	windsurfs	?
Funny	,	so	do	l	!
--------------------
Good	luck	!
It	's	great	to	have	a	place	where	you	can	change	things	.
I	can	't	at	my	folks	'	.
At	Fabien	's	I	don	't	feel	at	home	.
I	'd	love	to	turn	things	upside	down	,	but	I	won	't	.
We	quarrel	enough	as	it	is	.
He	's	adorable	,	but	he	gets	on	my	nerves	!
For	example	,	he	's	so	sweet	I	can	't	lie	to	him	!
You	don	't	have	to	.
Sometimes	you	do	!
--------------------
Some	things	are	better	left	unsaid	.
Especially	little	things	.
lf	I	ever	went	out	with	another	guy	...	he	'd	throw	a	fit	!
I	'm	very	faithful	...	but	it	could	happen	.
And	it	could	get	serious	.
With	the	other	guy	,	I	mean	.
I	'd	have	to	choose	.
But	I	could	only	leave	Fabien	in	slow	stages	.
So	for	a	while	I	'd	have	to	lie	...	when	I	'd	rather	tell	him	outright	:
"	I	don	't	love	you	"	.
--------------------
Do	you	love	him	now	?
I	still	do	.
But	he	's	getting	tougher	to	take	.
He	's	too	self-	centred	.
You	say	he	's	nice	.
They	can	go	together	.
He	makes	no	demands	,	but	he	's	got	no	initiative	,	either	.
Last	Friday	,	for	example	...	if	he	'd	really	wanted	me	to	go	with	him	,	I	'd	have	gone	.
I	wish	he	'd	seen	I	was	faking	illness	,	and	gotten	mad	.
With	him	,	all	my	little	games	fall	flat	!
--------------------
He	can	't	put	himself	in	my	place	.
He	's	not	considerate	.
I	'm	old-	fashioned	:
I	like	men	to	be	considerate	,	attentive	.
I	like	to	be	taken	care	of	.
He	's	too	young	.
Maybe	an	older	man	would	suit	me	better	.
It	must	be	lonely	living	here	.
I	feel	less	lonesome	here	than	in	a	little	house	.
You	've	really	got	no	boyfriend	?
--------------------
Maybe	I	'm	too	choosy	.
Yet	at	the	pool	yesterday	...	that	guy	caught	your	eye	.
He	's	above	average	.
That	's	why	I	noticed	him	.
He	's	not	your	type	.
I	have	a	type	?
Let	's	say	...
I	like	nice	looks	.
Surprised	?
Yes	and	no	.
--------------------
It	depends	what	you	mean	.
I	don	't	like	'em	ugly	either	.
But	Alexandre	is	a	seducer	,	knows	it	and	uses	it	.
Still	,	he	's	bright	,	has	a	good	job	,	he	's	a	good	catch	.
I	just	can	't	see	you	with	him	.
I	'm	not	cute	enough	?
He	's	not	serious-	minded	.
And	I	seem	serious-	minded	?
What	do	you	know	?
Can	you	swim	in	those	lakes	?
--------------------
Not	there	.
Beyond	the	trees	there	's	a	swimming	area	.
You	never	come	to	the	pool	.
I	belong	to	a	club	and	only	go	for	practice	.
He	's	a	champ	!
No	,	I	need	to	improve	.
When	I	do	something	,	it	's	all	the	way	.
You	know	Alexandre	?
Yeah	,	I	see	him	at	tennis	.
Since	we	're	on	about	the	same	level	,	I	enjoy	playing	him	.
--------------------
He	doesn	't	swim	?
Not	at	practice	,	anyway	.
Why	do	you	ask	?
Just	curious	.
We	saw	him	at	the	pool	.
He	swims	well	!
He	's	never	had	any	problems	.
He	's	always	had	it	all	!
Sports	,	music	,	math	,	lit	...	everything	's	easy	for	him	!
Too	easy	!
--------------------
I	'd	like	to	be	in	his	shoes	!
Not	me	.
When	you	're	good	at	too	many	things	...	it	's	hard	to	choose	.
When	all	the	girls	want	you	,	you	hesitate	,	then	pick	the	worst	.
He	has	terrible	taste	in	girls	.
I	'll	get	it	.
But	the	other	day	he	was	with	one	who	wasn	't	too	awful	.
At	the	pool	?
Girl	in	the	blue	swimsuit	with	a	red	anchor	on	it	.
You	didn	't	see	her	?
--------------------
He	dates	so	many	girls	...	and	they	're	not	as	bad	as	you	say	.
You	're	easy	to	please	!
Hope	you	find	me	prettier	!
Sure	do	.
lf	I	'm	prettier	than	them	,	and	he	's	sexier	than	you	,	then	he	ought	to	be	with	girls	prettier	than	l	.
But	you	don	't	think	he	's	sexier	.
I	'd	rather	be	me	than	him	.
Vain	creature	!
So	go	with	him	!
That	's	not	the	point	.
--------------------
He	'd	brush	you	off	?
That	'd	be	the	pits	.
With	his	taste	.
Just	because	he	's	handsome	doesn	't	mean	I	want	him	.
I	hate	guys	who	expect	girls	to	fall	into	their	arms	,	who	don	't	do	a	thing	,	as	if	it	were	normal	.
Just	because	he	's	not	after	you	!
Maybe	.
He	realizes	I	'm	different	.
Not	like	those	girls	who	swoon	over	him	.
Are	there	so	many	?
--------------------
I	know	one	who	's	dying	of	love	for	him	.
And	she	's	very	cute	.
He	doesn	't	want	her	?
She	hasn	't	tried	.
She	should	!
According	to	you	,	he	wants	them	all	!
ls	this	girl	for	real	?
Yes	,	but	it	's	not	Blanche	.
ldiot	!
Don	't	listen	to	her	!
--------------------
She	's	getting	used	to	my	dumb	jokes	.
Very	dumb	jokes	!
But	not	mean	.
Know	Blanche	?
We	've	met	,	but	where	?
At	the	pool	.
Right	...
Care	for	anything	?
Sure	.
Coffee	.
--------------------
Two	coffees	,	please	.
Go	often	?
Every	other	day	.
One	day	we	swim	,	one	we	lunch	.
I	do	the	same	,	but	I	must	go	on	odd	days	,	you	on	even	:
So	we	never	meet	up	.
You	serious	?
No	,	I	hardly	ever	go	.
I	lack	your	stamina	in	passing	up	lunch	.
It	's	not	stamina	:	we	enjoy	it	.
--------------------
Maybe	.
But	you	don	't	need	to	watch	your	figure	.
ls	that	a	dig	or	a	compliment	?
Definitely	a	compliment	.
Lots	of	girls	envy	you	...
Boys	too	.
You	?
Oh	!
You	saw	right	through	me	!
No	,	I	avoid	pools	,	especially	in	summer	.
--------------------
You	in	school	?
No	,	I	'm	...
She	's	a	big	shot	at	City	Hall	.
ln	local	government	.
You	're	so	young	!
Not	really	.
I	'm	24	.
2	years	older	than	me	!
You	're	a	bit	backward	!
We	can	't	all	have	an	M.	S.	!
--------------------
Ph.	D.	!
Sorry	!
Engineer	?
Power	and	light	.
He	's	got	a	great	job	.
You	should	marry	him	.
You	've	got	a	fine	job	too	.
So	?
Money	attracts	money	!
Like	it	here	?
--------------------
Very	much	.
15	TV	channels	,	a	lake	,	tennis	courts	,	golf	soon	,	2	legit	theatres	,	who	could	be	bored	?
I	'm	joking	,	but	I	like	it	here	too	.
I	don	't	belong	in	a	big	city	or	the	sticks	.
I	was	made	for	big	cities	.
But	I	feel	more	a	part	of	Paris	here	than	if	I	lived	right	in	the	centre	.
I	cover	all	of	metropolitan	Paris	from	here	,	north	to	south	,	east	to	west	.
I	'm	a	metropolitan	man	!
I	spend	hours	on	public	transport	too	,	but	it	's	no	blessing	.
Get	organized	!
--------------------
What	's	to	be	organized	?
Someday	I	'll	tell	you	.
Sooner	or	later	.
What	're	you	talking	about	?
You	'll	find	out	!
Do	you	even	know	?
You	got	me	.
Hit	the	nail	on	the	head	.
You	're	in	what	?
Cultural	Affairs	.
--------------------
Not	my	bag	.
Ever	deal	with	Financial	Affairs	?
Often	.
With	Mr.	Tissot	?
Keeps	tabs	on	the	tabs	,	he	does	!
And	Mrs.	Donangup	?
Who	?
You	don	't	know	Mrs.	Don	'ang	'up	?
No	,	I	know	Mrs.	Gillet	.
That	's	her	.
--------------------
Always	says	:
"	Don	't	hang	up	"	!
Don	't	make	fun	of	people	!
Am	I	being	mean	?
Not	at	all	.
She	's	always	kind	.
I	'm	not	!
Sooo	positive	!
Beats	being	negative	.
I	see	big	virtues	and	minor	flaws	.
--------------------
I	've	spent	half	an	hour	finding	you	!
I	said	here	.
You	said	the	main	square	!
You	don	't	listen	.
I	do	!
The	main	square	's	there	!
This	is	the	main	square	.
No	,	the	other	's	the	main	square	.
This	is	called	the	main	square	...
Sit	.
--------------------
Now	I	don	't	have	time	.
A	drink	?
I	don	't	feel	like	it	any	more	.
Really	?
Really	.
ln	that	case	,
I	'll	see	you	back	...
'	Bye	,	girls	.
Pleased	?
Still	like	him	?
--------------------
He	's	very	clever	.
I	sounded	like	a	complete	idiot	!
No	,	why	?
You	were	wonderful	.
I	didn	't	say	a	word	.
What	could	you	say	?
Maybe	I	talked	too	much	.
No	,	it	's	always	the	same	,	it	's	me	.
When	someone	interests	me	,	I	freeze	.
Now	's	your	chance	.
--------------------
He	and	that	girl	weren	't	so	cosy	!
Think	so	?
Sure	.
But	don	't	let	someone	beat	you	to	him	.
Today	,	you	got	in	line	.
Now	,	if	you	run	into	him	,	you	'll	manage	on	your	own	.
On	my	own	?
I	'd	be	petrified	!
When	I	want	to	dazzle	,	I	sound	dumb	...	so	I	shut	up	.
You	must	talk	to	him	.
--------------------
He	loves	bright	people	.
You	're	too	smart	to	sound	dumb	.
Take	my	advice	:	be	like	him	,	be	witty	,	make	fun	.
I	can	't	.
It	's	not	my	style	.
At	most	,	I	can	playact	a	bit	.
But	not	with	someone	I	want	to	love	me	.
I	want	to	be	loved	for	who	I	am	,	not	who	I	pretend	to	be	.
Then	don	't	chase	a	guy	like	him	.
You	'd	suit	lots	of	other	guys	!
--------------------
Naturally	!
Don	't	bother	with	a	guy	who	's	not	worth	it	!
You	here	?
Looking	for	you	.
I	had	meetings	all	day	.
I	have	news	that	's	both	good	and	bad	.
Like	what	?
I	leave	tomorrow	.
You	're	leaving	?
On	vacation	.
--------------------
Wonderful	!
But	I	won	't	see	you	.
You	'll	be	back	.
Not	here	.
Wherever	I	find	work	.
Wait	and	see	.
It	's	settled	.	lf	I	leave	Fabien	,	why	come	back	here	?
You	've	had	a	fight	?
Not	at	all	.
Let	's	change	the	subject	.
--------------------
I	need	rest	.
I	meant	to	go	in	July	when	he	gets	time	off	,	but	...
I	'm	going	alone	.
To	my	grandparents	'	.
I	may	go	to	the	Pyrenees	,	or	maybe	the	Alps	.
He	'll	join	you	?
Fabien	?
You	gotta	be	kidding	!
You	believed	me	?
You	're	not	going	?
--------------------
Sure	I	am	.
You	're	going	together	?
I	adore	you	!
You	always	believe	me	.
But	I	don	't	want	to	lie	to	you	.
My	parents	and	Fabien	always	think	I	'm	lying	.
So	I	lie	a	lot	.
I	'm	sort	of	leaving	with	a	guy	.
You	don	't	have	to	tell	me	.
I	want	to	.
--------------------
I	hate	knowing	secrets	.
No	one	'll	grill	you	.
Maybe	I	'm	in	love	.
And	Fabien	?
I	said	"	maybe	"	.
lf	I	'm	in	love	,	I	'll	leave	him	.
lf	I	'm	not	...
I	don	't	really	think	I	am	.
I	just	want	to	sock	it	to	Fabien	.
lf	he	loved	me	,	he	'd	have	timed	his	vacation	with	mine	.
--------------------
But	he	hates	changing	his	plans	.
And	for	him	work	's	sacred	.
Sure	.
He	's	just	starting	out	...
His	career	's	more	important	than	I	am	.
lf	you	love	him	,	his	career	matters	.
I	don	't	really	love	him	.
I	never	have	.
He	's	too	self-	centred	.
I	'd	like	to	find	someone	who	'd	counsel	me	,	understand	me	...	who	'd	just	try	and	please	me	now	and	then	.
--------------------
He	can	't	even	conceive	of	that	.
I	don	't	like	people	trying	to	please	me	.
Like	,	I	hate	presents	.
You	always	get	things	you	don	't	want	.
Well	,	I	like	them	.
Even	things	I	don	't	want	.
As	for	the	guy	I	'm	going	off	with	...
We	won	't	really	be	alone	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	us	...
I	doubt	he	's	Mr.	Right	,	but	I	just	might	fall	in	love	...
I	don	't	want	a	passing	affair	.
--------------------
I	'm	no	manhunter	.
Maybe	less	than	you	,	deep	down	.
I	've	been	alone	2	years	!
Right	,	I	said	deep	down	.
You	're	after	the	ultimate	,	I	'm	after	stability	.
You	'd	never	guess	,	eh	?
Come	for	dinner	?
I	'm	too	rushed	.
I	'll	walk	you	to	the	station	.
Wanna	go	to	the	French	Open	?
--------------------
Tennis	?
Got	a	ticket	?
Yeah	,	and	I	can	't	go	.
How	much	is	it	?
Nothing	.
Fabien	got	it	from	his	club	.
Will	he	go	?
Yes	.
Do	you	mind	?
The	seats	are	numbered	,	we	'll	sit	together	!
--------------------
So	what	?
He	won	't	eat	you	.
It	's	tricky	,	after	what	you	told	me	.
He	may	ask	questions	.
What	can	he	ask	?
Tell	him	the	official	version	:	it	's	the	truth	,	or	almost	.
But	I	so	hate	lying	.
lf	a	subject	comes	up	where	I	know	something	secret	,
I	blush	even	when	I	'm	telling	the	truth	.
So	...
--------------------
He	won	't	know	why	you	're	blushing	.
And	you	won	't	talk	of	that	.
Of	what	,	then	?
We	've	hardly	met	.
You	'll	get	to	know	him	.
He	's	not	that	interested	.
Nor	am	l	.
I	only	talk	to	him	because	of	you	.
lf	you	ever	split	up	,	I	'd	never	see	him	.
lf	I	leave	him	,	he	'll	be	available	.
--------------------
So	are	you	.
Who	knows	what	may	happen	?
Don	't	you	like	him	?
He	's	very	nice	.
But	my	girlfriends	'	boyfriends	...
I	feel	the	same	way	...
lf	he	's	no	longer	my	boyfriend	?
But	he	was	!
This	may	be	silly	,	but	...	he	's	a	no-	no	!
I	was	only	joking	.
--------------------
You	'll	have	a	friendly	chat	.
I	think	he	's	a	lot	like	you	.
You	have	more	to	talk	about	with	him	than	I	do	.
We	don	't	have	much	to	say	.
You	said	that	when	you	're	in	love	,	you	don	't	know	what	to	say	.
Here	you	're	not	in	love	...
So	?
And	you	may	see	Alexandre	.
It	's	now	or	never	!
Lea	told	you	she	gave	me	her	ticket	?
--------------------
That	guy	who	's	leading	,	I	saw	him	at	Wimbledon	last	year	.
What	time	is	it	?
Game	of	bridge	?
Now	?
Why	not	?
Got	the	cards	?
Coming	Adrienne	?
To	play	bridge	.
Come	on	!
You	sulking	?
--------------------
So	let	's	talk	.
Call	me	.
OK	,	if	we	can	play	...
Try	another	match	?
You	do	what	you	want	.
I	've	seen	enough	.
Spending	all	day	in	the	sun	,	in	a	crowd	...
This	isn	't	my	thing	.
A	drink	?
No	,	I	'm	tired	,	I	'm	going	home	.
--------------------
Sure	?
And	I	have	things	to	do	.
Might	do	you	good	.
No	,	really	.
'	Bye	Blanche	.
Hope	to	see	more	of	you	next	time	.
That	girl	's	really	weird	.
Good	to	see	you	.
I	wanted	to	apologize	for	Saturday	.
When	I	'm	in	a	vile	mood	,	please	shake	me	out	of	it	.
--------------------
I	don	't	get	it	,	what	did	you	do	?
I	left	with	your	date	,	and	you	left	alone	.
Who	?
Alexandre	?
Not	Alexandre	,	silly	!
Your	date	,	Fabien	!
He	's	Lea	's	boyfriend	!
I	know	he	is	,	but	you	came	with	him	.
Hardly	.
Lea	gave	me	her	ticket	,	and	I	wound	up	sitting	beside	him	.
--------------------
Oh	?
I	thought	you	were	closer	.
Anyway	,	he	likes	you	.
What	?
He	's	very	fond	of	you	and	was	sorry	you	left	.
I	'll	bet	!
You	sore	at	him	?
No	,	he	's	Lea	's	boyfriend	and	I	see	him	with	her	,	that	's	all	.
Scared	she	'd	be	jealous	?
She	must	be	hell	when	she	is	.
--------------------
I	don	't	steal	my	girlfriends	'	guys	!
It	's	over	,	she	's	all	but	left	him	.
He	told	you	?
I	sensed	it	.
You	can	sense	those	things	.
I	don	't	know	what	he	saw	in	that	girl	!
She	's	my	best	friend	.
Don	't	knock	her	!
Don	't	get	mad	!
I	'm	not	knocking	her	!
--------------------
I	just	said	they	didn	't	belong	together	.
They	're	trapped	.
Can	I	tell	you	something	?
Now	don	't	scream	!
I	sang	your	praises	.
I	went	overboard	.
Sang	my	praises	?
An	expression	.
Anyway	,	he	started	it	...
Praising	you	!
--------------------
I	felt	guilty	because	you	'd	left	.
He	said	you	were	a	great	girl	...
Not	the	self-	centred	kind	who	gets	mad	for	nothing	...
It	was	my	cue	to	cover	you	with	praise	.
So	there	!
OK	,	I	don	't	know	you	very	well	,	but	you	're	charming	,	and	I	have	a	real	instinct	about	people	.
Who	asked	you	?
ls	it	your	business	?
Hold	it	!
Anyway	,	he	wasn	't	listening	,	he	had	Lea	on	his	mind	!
--------------------
Bashful	lovers	annoy	me	so	,	I	'd	say	anything	to	bug	them	!
What	'd	you	tell	him	?
Nothing	.
I	knocked	Lea	,	and	praised	you	to	the	heavens	.
A	waste	of	time	,	he	's	lovestruck	,	deaf	to	the	world	.
It	was	a	waste	of	time	!
Hey	,	you	seem	all	sweetness	,	but	...	you	don	't	mince	your	words	.
Got	a	lover	?
Not	right	now	.
You	don	't	seem	to	want	Fabien	.
--------------------
I	won	't	saddle	you	with	Alexandre	.
He	's	even	less	your	type	.
As	they	're	the	only	two	half-	decent	lays	around	...
look	elsewhere	,	it	's	a	big	world	!
Sorry	about	the	other	day	,	I	had	to	get	home	.
Doesn	't	matter	.
Anyway	,	I	sort	of	abandoned	you	.
But	that	girl	can	be	so	possessive	...	no	way	to	get	rid	of	her	.
But	I	think	she	's	really	fond	of	you	.
I	know	!
--------------------
Well	,	have	a	nice	weekend	!
Same	to	you	.
It	's	a	small	world	!
This	place	is	like	a	village	.
Once	I	ran	into	the	same	person	7	times	...	and	I	'd	already	greeted	him	.
Doesn	't	bother	some	people	,	but	it	does	me	.
Should	I	say	"	hi	"	each	time	...	or	pretend	not	to	see	him	,	or	simply	avoid	him	?
You	could	smile	!
7	times	?
Today	it	's	only	the	second	.
--------------------
True	.
Once	again	,	have	a	good	week-	end	.
I	'm	off	to	windsurf	.
Been	yet	?
No	,	I	've	always	been	too	busy	,	and	with	this	weather	...
It	might	not	rain	,	but	there	's	a	good	wind	on	the	lake	.
Come	along	if	you	want	.
Now	?
Right	now	.
I	had	an	errand	to	do	,	but	it	can	wait	.
--------------------
It	's	stuck	.
I	can	't	unzip	it	.
It	's	the	lining	.
I	'm	so	impatient	!
These	things	usually	happen	to	me	and	I	flip	!
I	can	't	see	you	flipping	.
I	was	furious	at	the	store	earlier	!
Why	?
Because	it	's	Saturday	?
Crowded	?
--------------------
The	check-	out	I	thought	was	the	fastest	took	forever	!
I	went	nuts	!
Not	really	nuts	...
When	I	get	that	impatient	,	I	just	want	to	drop	everything	,
I	must	make	myself	keep	at	it	!
But	you	don	't	give	up	.
Just	once	,	I	was	buying	some	little	thing	...
I	quit	to	show	my	anger	without	beating	myself	up	.
I	'm	the	same	way	.
Sometimes	I	may	want	something	really	badly	,	but	I	'll	wait	for	ages	,	then	suddenly	drop	it	all	so	...
--------------------
It	's	weird	,	but	...
Lea	and	I	have	almost	nothing	in	common	.
It	's	not	physical	effort	,	she	can	be	tougher	than	I	am	.
Not	just	swimming	,	but	walking	,	even	holding	a	racket	tires	her	.
Yet	she	can	dance	all	night	or	shop	all	day	.
That	exhausts	me	!
What	relaxes	me	tires	her	and	vice	versa	.
How	can	you	live	together	?
We	don	't	.
Lea	doesn	't	live	at	my	place	.
--------------------
She	crashes	there	weekdays	and	goes	to	her	folks	'	on	weekends	.
I	could	go	,	but	don	't	care	to	.
She	feels	the	same	.
She	thinks	I	didn	't	want	to	go	on	vacation	with	her	.
She	's	wrong	.
lf	she	'd	warned	me	,	I	could	've	managed	.
She	just	took	off	to	her	grandparents	'	.
That	where	she	is	?
I	know	,	she	told	me	.
She	told	me	,	too	.
--------------------
I	don	't	have	to	believe	her	.
There	's	a	guy	involved	!
lf	she	leaves	me	,	too	bad	.
It	'll	hurt	at	first	,	but	I	'll	get	over	it	.
She	's	too	young	for	me	,	and	I	'm	too	young	for	her	,	too	.
I	'm	dining	with	friends	.
Join	me	?
No	,	I	have	plans	.
Will	you	be	here	tomorrow	?
Tomorrow	I	relax	.
--------------------
It	'll	be	sunny	all	week	.
How	about	some	evening	?
OK	.
I	'm	busy	early	in	the	week	.
Thursday	or	Friday	?
No	,	I	can	't	.
Saturday	?
OK	.
Daydreaming	?
Not	at	all	.
--------------------
We	meet	again	.
Been	to	the	lakes	?
I	'm	on	my	way	.
The	weather	's	lousy	,	but	the	wind	is	good	.
Come	along	if	you	want	.
I	can	't	.
I	'm	off	to	Paris	.
I	'm	going	,	or	it	'll	be	too	late	.
Saturday	?
OK	.
--------------------
Where	's	your	car	?
ln	the	lot	.
See	you	!
Do	you	sail	?
Boats	,	but	on	the	ocean	.
I	've	only	dabbled	at	windsurfing	.
I	have	to	go	,	too	.
You	going	to	Paris	?
By	and	by	.
I	can	take	you	.
--------------------
Well	,	it	's	that	...
You	've	got	your	car	?
I	'm	taking	the	train	.
Come	back	by	train	!
I	wanted	to	go	home	first	...
You	live	far	?
Saint-	Christophe	.
Will	you	be	long	?
Not	really	...
I	see	I	'm	not	being	helpful	!
--------------------
Have	a	nice	evening	.
See	you	.
You	're	really	hopeless	!
For	a	shy	girl	,	you	talk	a	lot	!
I	can	talk	with	you	,	and	Lea	...	with	people	at	the	office	...
With	everyone	,	in	fact	!
Except	when	I	freeze	.
Freeze	?
When	I	like	someone	...	or	think	I	do	,
I	go	dumb	.
--------------------
Or	I	say	stupid	,	trivial	things	.
See	who	I	mean	?
Alexandre	?
We	kidded	you	a	bit	,	you	really	interested	in	him	?
Did	you	stay	with	him	the	other	day	?
I	blew	it	!
He	gave	me	an	opening	.
Offered	to	drive	me	to	Paris	.
Like	a	fool	,	I	hemmed	and	hawed	...
It	upset	my	plans	,	which	were	upset	anyway	.
--------------------
He	backed	off	,	and	I	missed	a	great	chance	!
There	'll	be	others	,	and	...
And	?
You	're	not	missing	much	!
I	can	't	see	why	you	like	this	guy	!
You	're	like	Lea	!
You	say	he	's	a	ladies	'	man	,	but	not	for	this	lady	!
Maybe	you	're	just	different	.
How	so	?
I	don	't	know	,	but	...
--------------------
I	can	't	see	you	with	him	.
He	's	handsome	and	I	'm	ugly	?
That	what	you	mean	?
Silly	!
You	're	not	ugly	!
You	think	so	.
Not	a	bit	!
I	think	you	're	very	pretty	,	pretty	as	anyone	.
Not	as	pretty	as	Lea	!
Don	't	talk	nonsense	!
--------------------
OK	,	let	's	talk	about	Lea	!
This	might	surprise	you	,	but	Lea	's	not	my	type	!
I	didn	't	notice	her	...	she	chased	me	.
lf	I	'm	attracted	to	a	type	at	all	,	you	come	much	closer	.
Stop	this	flattery	!
I	didn	't	think	you	were	like	that	.
It	's	not	flattery	.
It	's	what	I	think	,	spoken	as	a	friend	.
I	'm	trying	to	understand	,	you	:::	me	:::
I	love	Lea	but	we	're	too	different	.
--------------------
Maybe	I	love	her	unexpectedness	.
But	I	feel	closer	to	you	,	and	I	've	only	known	you	for	a	week	.
That	's	the	difference	between	love	and	friendship	.
ln	love	,	you	don	't	feel	you	're	on	his	level	.
I	wonder	.
But	speaking	of	levels	...
Alexandre	's	way	beneath	you	!
You	mean	morally	?
Physically	,	too	.
He	's	ordinary	:	everyone	's	type	.
--------------------
Loving	him	makes	you	ordinary	.
Maybe	I	am	ordinary	!
You	overrate	me	.
I	rate	you	high	and	I	'm	right	!
I	think	you	're	terrific	!
I	say	it	and	it	's	true	!
I	don	't	believe	you	!
I	'll	be	going	.
Tomorrow	it	'll	be	nice	.
Leave	your	car	,	I	'll	pick	you	up	.
--------------------
OK	.
Good	night	.
Better	than	the	smell	of	fried	fish	and	trash	.
I	brought	Lea	here	one	Sunday	.
She	swore	she	'd	never	be	back	!
I	feel	like	I	'm	in	a	foreign	country	.
Here	I	accept	things	,	like	odours	,	that	disgust	me	elsewhere	.
Actually	,	it	's	like	travelling	through	time	.
When	workers	would	picnic	on	the	banks	of	the	Seine	...
I	thought	all	that	was	over	.
--------------------
These	people	aren	't	from	Cergy	.
They	live	in	crowded	high-	rises	,	in	crummy	suburbs	.
To	them	,	this	place	is	the	Palace	of	Versailles	!
I	prefer	the	smell	of	hot-	dogs	to	exhaust	fumes	in	a	Sunday	afternoon	traffic	jam	.
Me	too	.
There	's	the	river	!
Yes	,	behind	those	trees	.
It	loops	around	.
There	you	can	see	it	.
It	drops	down	close	to	where	you	live	.
--------------------
There	's	the	tower	!
It	flows	on	,	circles	around	the	town	,	by	the	...
Power	and	Light	building	.
I	know	a	nice	towpath	along	the	river	.
Are	you	crying	?
ls	it	the	sun	?
No	...
I	don	't	know	...
Maybe	the	silence	...	or	the	hour	,	because	...	when	the	sun	starts	to	set	,	you	feel	a	pang	of	anxiety	...
And	I	feel	good	...
--------------------
Too	good	,	in	fact	!
Why	too	good	?
Too	good	...
I	'm	sorry	.
May	l	?
Sorry	...
It	's	nerves	.
Never	mind	.
It	's	OK	.
Especially	if	they	're	tears	of	joy	.
--------------------
I	wish	they	were	,	but	that	's	not	it	.
Tell	me	if	I	can	help	.
No	,	no	...
Just	silly	girlish	ideas	.
And	...
it	's	something	I	can	't	tell	you	...	especially	you	.
Especially	me	?
Why	?
Can	you	tell	me	?
I	'm	crying	because	you	're	here	,	and	it	's	with	you	...
--------------------
Want	me	to	go	?
No	,	don	't	go	!
I	'm	happy	with	you	.
Only	...
I	'd	like	...
I	should	...
I	'd	like	to	be	as	happy	with	someone	else	as	with	you	now	.
You	'll	have	your	Alexandre	.
I	don	't	know	if	I	could	be	as	happy	with	him	.
So	forget	him	.
--------------------
There	's	no	reason	not	to	feel	...	as	happy	with	a	lover	as	with	a	friend	.
Sure	,	but	that	's	often	how	it	is	.
I	feel	better	with	you	now	...	than	with	Lea	.
Let	's	not	talk	.
May	l	?
You	're	adorable	!
No	more	.
You	agree	?
I	guess	.
I	don	't	know	.
--------------------
I	think	I	really	like	you	.
I	won	't	do	anything	you	don	't	want	.
You	thought	I	wanted	to	?
Yes	,	I	'm	very	wilful	.
I	do	nothing	I	don	't	want	.
But	Lea	's	a	close	friend	.
So	that	's	it	.
I	thought	it	was	...
Alexandre	?
Yes	,	a	little	.
--------------------
But	mostly	Lea	.
Lea	...	she	's	having	a	ball	.
This	your	revenge	?
Certainly	not	!
I	'm	not	thinking	of	Lea	...	but	of	you	and	me	.
I	feel	we	're	alone	on	a	desert	island	.
I	used	to	dream	of	seeing	a	girl	in	a	forest	.
We	'd	meet	in	a	clearing	...	come	together	,	spellbound	,	make	love	,	then	drift	apart	again	,	still	nameless	.
It	's	a	boy	's	dream	,	not	a	girl	's	.
Really	?
--------------------
I	'd	have	said	a	girl	's	...
Mine	,	in	fact	...
But	...
But	what	?
Nothing	.
I	'll	be	off	.
No	,	not	now	.
When	,	then	?
It	's	over	.
Over	?
--------------------
How	,	over	?
It	was	great	,	and	to	stay	great	it	mustn	't	go	on	.
You	don	't	want	to	see	me	any	more	?
Sure	I	'll	see	you	.
But	only	as	a	friend	.
A	friend	?
We	're	not	in	love	.
You	love	someone	else	.
So	do	l	.
Listen	,	I	don	't	know	if	I	love	Lea	,	but	I	feel	more	than	friendly	to	you	.
--------------------
You	mustn	't	.
Some	things	shouldn	't	be	repeated	.
I	've	been	happier	with	you	than	with	anyone	else	.
Then	it	'd	be	dumb	to	stop	.
You	're	not	thinking	.
To	you	,	I	'm	a	replacement	.
As	you	were	to	me	.
Are	you	crazy	?
Don	't	spoil	our	memory	.
It	'll	be	our	secret	.
--------------------
Alright	.
You	swear	you	won	't	tell	Lea	?
Naturally	.
Where	are	you	?
At	your	folks	'	?
Come	to	my	place	tonight	.
Coming	!
You	've	moved	the	sofa	.
An	impulse	,	like	it	?
Very	much	.
--------------------
Want	a	drink	?
I	'd	love	one	.
You	see	?
I	haven	't	vanished	.
I	knew	you	wouldn	't	.
Surprise	!
We	're	neighbours	again	.
I	'm	back	with	Fabien	.
You	look	amazed	.
So	you	should	.
--------------------
After	what	I	told	you	!
But	I	was	stupid	.
I	love	Fabien	.
I	realize	it	when	we	part	.
That	guy	I	more	or	less	left	with	...	a	fiasco	!
A	complete	blank	!
There	were	other	guys	...	not	bad	...
But	not	one	clicked	.
None	of	them	holds	a	candle	to	Fabien	!
It	's	always	been	the	same	routine	.
--------------------
I	leave	him	,	try	to	cheat	on	him	,
I	pull	up	short	,
I	come	back	,	and	fall	into	his	arms	.
His	vacation	's	next	week	.
We	'll	leave	together	.
And	you	?
Things	OK	?
Just	fine	.
Really	?
Like	I	said	.
--------------------
You	're	acting	strange	.
Sure	,	if	you	look	at	me	like	that	...
It	's	because	you	seem	different	.
Not	exactly	like	you	were	before	I	left	.
This	happens	to	me	.
I	don	't	see	someone	for	a	week	or	two	,	and	I	think	they	've	changed	.
But	they	haven	't	changed	.
It	's	my	vision	of	them	.
My	way	of	looking	changes	.
Funny	,	no	?
--------------------
No	,	that	happens	to	me	,	too	,	but	...	the	interval	's	longer	.
Do	I	look	different	?
You	're	tanned	,	that	's	all	.
So	are	you	.
That	must	be	it	.
Been	swimming	?
A	bit	of	windsurfing	.
Then	you	've	seen	Fabien	?
He	was	out	Saturday	and	Sunday	.
Alone	?
--------------------
Don	't	answer	!
lf	ever	you	know	anything	awkward	,	I	forbid	you	to	tell	me	.
For	now	,	we	're	euphoric	.
lf	only	it	lasts	!
Another	drink	?
By	the	way	...
like	the	tennis	?
An	interesting	match	.
Was	Alexandre	there	?
Yes	,	but	we	hardly	spoke	.
--------------------
Did	he	recognize	you	?
Of	course	.
We	exchanged	a	few	words	.
A	few	!
Just	trivia	.
I	'm	not	nosy	,	you	know	.
I	couldn	't	think	of	what	to	say	.
I	ran	into	him	a	few	days	later	.
Couldn	't	talk	to	him	then	,	either	.
You	still	like	him	?
--------------------
More	than	ever	.
And	I	have	a	strong	feeling	he	's	interested	.
So	...
I	persist	!
Maybe	someday	I	'll	connect	.
I	hope	so	.
You	know	how	I	feel	about	it	.
But	I	won	't	try	to	stop	you	.
I	can	even	help	you	.
Free	Saturday	?
--------------------
Why	?
We	're	going	to	a	party	.
Want	to	join	us	?
Who	's	"	us	"	?
Fabien	and	me	.
I	think	Alexandre	'll	be	there	,	too	.
Well	,	why	not	?
Great	!
You	OK	?
Fine	,	and	you	?
--------------------
You	're	lovely	!
So	are	you	!
Find	your	way	?
I	wound	up	in	Versailles	.
The	long	way	.
You	didn	't	take	the	direct	road	?
I	got	sidetracked	.
It	's	shorter	...
Not	everyone	's	here	yet	,	but	...
I	'll	be	back	.
--------------------
Are	we	going	to	be	like	the	other	day	?
I	don	't	think	so	.
Sore	at	me	?
What	for	?
I	don	't	know	.
No	,	it	's	all	working	out	.
I	was	right	!
Whose	house	is	this	?
Whose	?
Friends	of	friends	of	Alexandre	...
--------------------
I	only	know	2	or	3	...
I	don	't	know	them	...
Seen	the	garden	?
I	'll	show	it	to	you	.
How	goes	it	?
So-	so	.
Very	nice	...
You	too	,	very	nice	!
Join	us	in	a	drink	?
Gladly	.
--------------------
I	'll	just	have	some	water	.
I	'm	drinking	tonight	.
A	glass	of	white	wine	...
White	wine	?
Pretty	,	huh	?
It	's	a	lovely	house	.
Friends	of	yours	?
Friends	of	friends	.
Lea	,	you	know	them	as	well	as	I	do	.
I	think	so	.
--------------------
So	we	're	all	guests	,	and	no	one	knows	anyone	.
That	's	the	point	of	parties	.
Sorry	,	I	have	to	leave	.
So	soon	?
I	have	lots	of	work	before	vacation	,	I	had	to	take	some	home	with	me	.
Too	bad	,	we	don	't	meet	often	.
You	're	off	when	?
ln	a	week	and	a	half	...
See	you	before	then	.
ln	fact	,	what	're	you	doing	Friday	?
--------------------
Nothing	special	,	why	?
A	party	at	St.	Germain	.
What	address	?
I	'm	not	sure	.
We	can	meet	at	the	Columbia	.
7	P.	M.	?
OK	.
We	'll	use	your	car	?
My	car	!
Nice	,	the	blue	.
--------------------
Told	you	he	'd	come	.
Whose	party	is	it	?
My	brother	's	pals	'	graduation	party	.
They	're	kids	!
What	'll	he	do	there	?
lf	he	doesn	't	like	it	,	he	'll	leave	!
What	a	day	!
Know	what	's	happened	?
I	broke	up	with	Fabien	!
This	time	it	's	for	good	.
--------------------
I	hope	not	.
You	'll	patch	it	up	,	as	always	.
Not	this	time	.
No	hard	feelings	.
We	didn	't	even	quarrel	.
It	was	very	quiet	,	matter-	of-	fact	.
Surprised	,	eh	?
Sorry	,	I	don	't	believe	it	.
Vacations	agree	with	me	.
I	'll	put	this	here	...
--------------------
When	do	you	go	?
I	'm	just	back	.
I	may	go	again	,	but	when	?
With	Fabien	?
Yes	...	no	...
I	don	't	know	.
And	you	?
Next	week	.
I	don	't	know	where	.
You	like	snap	decisions	,	eh	?
--------------------
Like	me	.
Where	we	off	to	?
Some	friends	'	.
Friends	'	friends	.
They	nice	?
Must	be	!
My	brother	's	pals	.
You	have	a	brother	?
How	old	?
He	's	18	.
--------------------
Just	graduated	.
They	'll	think	I	'm	an	antique	.
Us	,	too	.	lf	we	're	bored	,	we	'll	go	elsewhere	.
I	get	it	:	you	don	't	want	to	go	alone	,	Fabien	won	't	take	you	,	so	you	pick	me	.
Us	,	that	is	.
As	you	say	,	if	we	're	bored	,	we	split	.
That	it	?
Besides	,	you	may	meet	someone	...
I	won	't	ditch	the	two	charming	ladies	I	'm	with	.
Me	you	can	,	but	Blanche	...
--------------------
Was	the	party	fun	?
Great	.
You	should	've	stayed	.
I	had	to	work	.
Besides	,	I	had	a	feeling	I	was	in	the	way	.
ln	the	way	?
ln	our	way	?
You	crazy	?
People	there	you	didn	't	know	.
Pretty	vague	...
--------------------
I	guess	I	can	tell	you	...
I	happened	to	be	a	witness	by	accident	...	to	a	romance	between	two	people	I	know	who	I	thought	were	strangers	.
I	nearly	introduced	them	,	until	I	saw	they	knew	each	other	better	than	I	knew	either	of	them	.
Get	it	?
Maybe	you	knew	the	girl	well	...
No	,	no	,	she	's	not	my	type	.
You	have	a	type	?
Of	course	!
Like	what	?
Voluptuous	women	of	40	!
--------------------
Why	not	?
Sure	,	why	not	?
You	won	't	meet	any	tonight	.
That	's	OK	.
You	have	one	?
Nosy	,	isn	't	she	?
What	?
Am	I	nosy	or	not	?
Yes	,	a	little	.
I	don	't	feel	well	.
--------------------
Maybe	it	's	the	ice	cream	.
A	coffee	?
A	liqueur	?
No	thanks	,	I	'd	better	go	home	.
You	have	no	car	!
I	can	take	you	back	.
There	's	a	train	soon	.
Come	on	.
It	'll	take	me	a	minute	!
What	's	wrong	with	her	?
--------------------
Nothing	.
Just	cold	feet	.
It	happens	to	the	best	of	us	.
Cold	feet	?
Why	?
Don	't	play	dumb	!
She	's	afraid	of	me	?
She	's	afraid	you	don	't	feel	for	her	what	she	feels	for	you	.
It	's	so	obvious	that	it	's	no	secret	.
Her	fear	is	justified	.
--------------------
I	'm	surprised	she	hasn	't	figured	that	out	!
Love	is	blind	.
Love	's	a	big	word	!
She	's	so	in	love	with	you	that	...
I	don	't	want	you	playing	cat	and	mouse	with	her	.
Did	I	lead	her	on	?
Where	?
When	?
I	've	always	been	distant	,	even	cold	to	her	!
Then	why	'd	you	come	?
--------------------
You	knew	something	was	up	.
She	didn	't	invite	me	!
She	's	boring	.
But	you	I	like	.
lf	you	weren	't	taken	...
Don	't	try	to	pick	me	up	!
Never	!
Your	guy	's	a	friend	!
My	guy	?
He	's	my	ex	.
--------------------
My	things	are	in	that	bag	.
I	've	just	moved	out	.
You	're	kidding	!
I	've	left	Fabien	.
I	'm	homeless	!
Come	to	my	place	.
Hold	on	!
I	'm	going	to	my	folks	'	!
And	I	plan	to	stay	there	a	while	!
I	'm	too	young	to	set	up	house	.
--------------------
I	suggest	,	sir	,	that	you	behave	!
OK	,	I	'll	behave	.
Sure	you	want	to	go	to	this	party	?
We	'll	stop	by	,	then	go	to	dinner	.
Glad	to	see	you	!
How	're	you	doing	?
OK	.
You	look	glum	!
How	come	you	're	not	away	on	vacation	?
I	'm	going	next	week	.
--------------------
And	you	?
I	've	already	been	.
I	come	and	go	...
You	going	home	?
Yes	.
That	's	cute	!
Do	you	have	plans	for	this	evening	?
lf	you	want	...
I	'm	taking	the	train	...
I	'm	going	to	a	gallery	opening	in	Paris	.
--------------------
A	young	painter	,	I	don	't	know	his	work	,	but	he	seems	sensitive	,	could	be	interesting	.
Want	to	go	?
Come	on	,	give	in	!
I	don	't	know	what	I	'll	do	,	I	was	going	away	with	Fabien	...
Since	I	don	't	like	the	ocean	...	and	he	doesn	't	like	the	country	,	we	had	to	compromise	.
We	realized	we	'd	be	better	off	separating	!
For	vacation	and	for	good	.
Now	I	don	't	know	where	to	go	!
Come	with	me	!
I	'm	going	to	visit	friends	.
--------------------
We	won	't	be	alone	.
You	'll	meet	handsome	guys	.
That	's	an	idea	.
But	what	would	Blanche	think	?
What	about	her	?
That	girl	means	nothing	to	me	,	got	it	?
She	's	my	friend	.
She	'd	die	if	I	took	her	man	.
I	'm	not	hers	and	never	will	be	!
She	should	know	she	hasn	't	a	hope	!
--------------------
What	do	you	have	against	her	?
I	think	she	's	very	nice	...
And	very	pretty	.
But	she	's	not	at	all	my	type	.
What	's	your	type	?
Aside	from	dumpy	40-	year-	olds	?
Anyone	but	her	.
I	'm	allergic	to	small	,	moon-	faced	girls	!
You	're	mean	!
lf	you	must	know	,	I	like	slender	,	rather	tall	girls	.
--------------------
Blondes	or	brunettes	?
Brunettes	.
With	smooth	,	light	,	slightly	tanned	skin	.
They	really	attract	me	.
Especially	when	they	have	big	eyes	and	silky	lashes	.
Cut	it	out	.
You	promised	not	to	lay	it	on	!
I	'm	not	laying	it	on	!
You	asked	what	my	type	was	!
You	're	much	closer	than	Adrienne	to	my	ideal	.
--------------------
You	've	always	attracted	me	.
But	fate	was	against	it	.
Fate	!
You	control	yours	,	don	't	be	modest	!
You	're	wrong	!
I	don	't	like	to	push	.
I	'm	no	Romeo	.
The	fact	is	,	girls	like	me	!
It	's	given	me	bad	habits	.
It	can	be	a	disadvantage	.
--------------------
They	seek	me	out	,	so	I	just	relax	.
Means	I	don	't	always	wind	up	with	the	best	.
lf	I	like	a	girl	,	I	'll	meet	her	sooner	or	later	...
Better	later	,	then	too	soon	.
Take	us	...
I	'm	glad	I	met	you	now	,	not	6	months	ago	.
We	're	both	available	...
Stop	it	!
What	's	available	mean	?
And	I	don	't	like	your	kind	of	guy	.
--------------------
I	like	to	be	wooed	!
You	were	with	Fabien	!
You	should	have	been	insanely	jealous	.
Who	says	I	wasn	't	?
Actions	talk	!
You	should	've	done	something	wild	!
Let	's	run	away	.
I	'll	kidnap	you	!
That	's	not	so	wild	.
And	I	said	no	!
--------------------
I	heard	yes	.
It	meant	no	.
I	'll	think	of	something	wilder	...
Come	live	with	me	!
You	've	even	got	your	bags	!
My	place	's	too	big	for	me	alone	.
When	you	're	alone	!
I	'm	alone	now	.
Stay	that	way	.
My	folks	are	expecting	me	.
--------------------
Call	them	back	!
They	're	asleep	.
So	they	're	not	waiting	up	!
I	might	move	in	with	you	,	but	not	now	.
We	've	known	each	other	6	months	,	so	wait	6	more	months	.
During	that	period	,	you	mustn	't	date	anyone	else	.
Then	maybe	I	'll	let	myself	be	wooed	!
I	accept	.
But	you	mustn	't	date	anyone	,	either	.
That	suits	me	fine	!
--------------------
6	months	is	a	bit	long	.
How	about	6	days	?
You	're	going	on	vacation	.
Then	come	with	me	!
It	's	late	.
Take	me	home	?
It	's	funny	,	I	can	't	see	you	a	bureaucrat	.
That	's	what	you	are	though	.
You	should	be	in	the	arts	.
You	never	wanted	to	paint	,	or	write	?
--------------------
I	've	no	talent	.
Even	if	I	did	...
I	'm	not	sure	I	'd	want	to	do	it	for	a	living	.
Art	for	me	is	pure	pleasure	.
Contemplating	it	is	enough	.
I	can	understand	that	.
It	's	just	that	...
ln	your	office	,	they	're	all	bureaucrats	,
Real	ones	!
It	's	a	bad	environment	.
--------------------
All	they	think	about	is	rank	...	climbing	the	ladder	...	spending	their	lives	...	stepping	over	people	.
They	don	't	even	think	about	work	...	much	less	love	!
I	know	what	I	'm	talking	about	!
Alexandre	...	is	just	like	that	.
He	's	a	brilliant	bureaucrat	.
Period	.
Better	than	average	,	but	barely	.
He	's	very	handsome	,	that	's	sure	.
lntelligent	...	clever	...
More	clever	than	intelligent	.
--------------------
At	times	I	wondered	about	...	his	intelligence	.
I	fell	in	love	with	him	to	spite	the	people	in	my	school	.
They	're	the	opposite	:	they	affect	artiness	.
So	they	talk	loud	,	act	snobbish	...
I	may	not	find	what	I	want	.
I	need	a	real	artist	,	with	the	soul	of	an	artist	,	and	the	allure	of	a	rising	young	executive	.
I	'm	dreaming	,	but	people	like	that	exist	.
Heard	of	Yves	Klein	,	who	painted	those	big	blue	canvases	?
Blanche	,	call	me	as	soon	as	possible
See	you	,	Fabien
--------------------
Going	to	eat	?
I	was	even	going	to	meet	someone	.
I	won	't	have	much	time	for	lunch	.
It	's	a	busy	period	.
This	morning	I	went	shopping	,	now	I	'm	off	to	see	my	folks	.
I	'll	be	back	Monday	,	but	Tuesday	I	leave	for	St.	Malo	.
But	I	had	to	see	you	...
I	feel	odd	about	the	other	night	.
So	do	l	.
Did	you	see	Lea	again	?
--------------------
Last	night	.
She	vaguely	told	me	...
It	's	not	vague	...	at	least	that	's	how	I	feel	.
We	decided	to	split	up	for	good	.
There	were	no	harsh	words	.
We	both	agreed	to	it	.
We	can	't	enjoy	our	vacations	together	.
Someone	has	to	give	in	.
Just	for	vacations	?
And	the	rest	.
--------------------
The	vacations	brought	it	all	to	a	head	.
Why	did	we	pick	it	up	again	when	she	came	back	?
You	loved	her	.
I	always	felt	that	.
No	,	I	'd	stopped	loving	her	.
You	wouldn	't	believe	me	.
Maybe	I	only	went	back	because	I	knew	I	didn	't	love	her	.
What	are	you	saying	?
I	know	it	's	not	easy	to	understand	...
You	won	't	like	my	explanation	.
--------------------
Does	it	make	me	look	bad	?
No	,	on	the	contrary	.
It	may	even	have	happened	to	you	,	inexperienced	as	you	are	...
As	I	am	,	for	that	matter	.
But	when	you	leave	someone	for	someone	else	,	for	a	moment	you	miss	the	first	person	.
So	if	I	went	back	to	Lea	,	it	proves	I	'd	really	opted	for	you	.
Why	not	say	I	came	off	a	poor	second	?
Why	always	put	yourself	down	?
Even	if	you	don	't	care	if	I	love	you	,	at	least	believe	me	.
You	were	right	to	be	mad	at	me	.
--------------------
That	's	why	I	came	.
To	show	you	I	'm	no	butterfly	.
That	's	why	!
You	'll	say	it	's	unimportant	,	since	you	love	someone	else	.
But	it	matters	to	me	.
What	other	?
Whosit	...
Alexandre	?
I	don	't	like	him	anymore	.
Really	?
--------------------
Since	when	?
Yesterday	.
OK	,	it	took	time	,	but	better	late	than	never	.
How	'd	you	find	out	?
Watching	him	talk	to	Lea	.
I	had	nothing	to	say	.
I	wasn	't	intimidated	,	I	didn	't	want	to	.
I	realized	that	what	I	loved	wasn	't	a	person	,	but	an	image	...	of	a	man	chasing	me	,	a	childish	dream	I	'm	too	old	for	.
But	now	it	's	over	.
The	image	has	faded	completely	.
--------------------
It	all	happened	in	a	flash	.
What	was	white	became	black	,	and	vice	versa	.
Even	images	don	't	disappear	like	that	!
They	can	.
You	see	...	a	month	ago	,	if	he	'd	fallen	in	love	with	me	,	or	said	he	had	,
I	'd	have	been	thrilled	.
I	'd	have	felt	secure	all	my	life	.
But	if	that	had	happened	,	I	think	that	,	there	and	then	,	I	'd	have	lost	interest	in	him	.
And	now	I	've	met	someone	with	whom	the	very	opposite	happened	.
You	're	happy	with	me	?
--------------------
Yes	.
Would	you	like	to	stay	with	me	?
Yes	.
Don	't	leave	.
I	have	to	go	,	but	I	'll	be	back	Monday	.
To	leave	again	?
Yes	...	but	with	you	,	if	you	want	.
lf	you	don	't	change	your	mind	.
I	never	will	again	.
ls	that	okay	?
--------------------
I	have	to	go	now	.
What	's	more	,	I	have	to	drop	Lea	's	things	at	her	folks	'	.
Then	you	'll	see	her	?
Don	't	tell	her	.
I	doubt	she	'll	be	there	,	but	I	wouldn	't	tell	her	anyway	.
Though	sometimes	I	really	want	to	.
Better	not	.
It	's	too	soon	.
I	want	to	do	it	gently	.
She	might	take	it	badly	.
--------------------
But	it	's	all	over	between	us	.
Even	so	.
I	'd	better	run	.
See	you	in	the	restaurant	,	Monday	?
Here	at	1	o	'clock	?
Sweet	dreams	!
It	's	late	,	we	'd	better	get	back	.
Already	?
Time	really	flies	!
I	feel	I	've	been	with	you	for	centuries	.
--------------------
Six	days	?
No	,	six	months	!
I	'm	off	.
We	can	meet	at	a	restaurant	.
The	Olympia	or	the	Columbia	?
No	...	we	might	run	into	Blanche	.
So	what	?
lf	she	sees	us	together	,	she	'll	flip	.
Remember	Friday	?
She	realized	then	,	and	in	time	she	'll	find	out	.
--------------------
But	not	so	brutally	.
Being	told	is	different	than	seeing	it	.
Depends	how	it	's	said	.
Figure	out	a	way	,	I	want	to	be	alone	with	you	.
Somewhere	no	one	will	see	us	.
Like	the	lakeside	restaurant	...
Blanche	!
You	here	?
What	a	surprise	!
I	came	for	lunch	.
--------------------
And	you	?
Just	passing	,	with	friends	...
They	're	down	below	.
I	was	looking	for	a	phone	.
May	I	sit	down	?
Am	I	bothering	you	?
I	might	as	well	tell	you	right	out	:	the	other	day	...
Don	't	tell	me	,	I	know	.
You	do	?
I	can	guess	,	anyway	.
--------------------
Listen	,	it	's	alright	.
You	're	sweet	to	come	and	tell	me	.
Men	are	cowards	!
That	's	a	bit	strong	!
Well	,	'bye	.
Oh	,	I	haven	't	paid	!
Now	wait	,	Blanche	.
Listen	,	I	'm	sorry	.
From	your	point	of	view	,	I	'm	a	rat	,	I	know	.
But	I	didn	't	promote	it	.
--------------------
You	must	understand	.
We	fell	into	each	other	's	arms	.
I	'm	still	not	over	it	.
I	shouldn	't	have	been	so	blunt	.
It	's	better	that	way	.
You	must	hate	me	,	no	?
You	,	no	.
Him	!
He	's	crazy	!
He	has	a	right	not	to	love	you	.
--------------------
OK	,	but	let	him	say	so	.
He	always	has	.
Maybe	to	you	,	but	he	told	me	the	opposite	.
What	?
When	?
You	didn	't	know	?
Then	I	have	news	for	you	.
We	dated	while	you	were	on	vacation	...
I	took	him	home	...	and	we	spent	the	night	together	.
You	slept	with	him	?
--------------------
It	's	impossible	,	you	're	making	it	up	!
It	's	absolutely	true	!
Well	...
I	certainly	never	expected	this	!
What	was	that	act	all	about	?
What	act	?
Yours	,	pretending	to	...
I	didn	't	put	on	any	act	!
He	did	!
Him	and	his	weird	routine	!
--------------------
Saying	he	was	at	his	folks	'	,	when	he	was	with	you	!
It	beats	me	!
I	don	't	get	it	!
Drives	me	nuts	!
Hold	on	,	now	I	'm	confused	.
He	told	you	what	?
He	'd	go	to	his	folks	'	!
When	?
Saturday	!
You	saw	him	?
--------------------
Across	the	way	there	,	on	Saturday	!
You	're	delirious	!
You	've	lost	your	mind	!
You	saw	Alexandre	here	Saturday	?
I	'm	talking	about	Fabien	!
And	I	mean	Alexandre	!
No	,	I	'm	talking	about	Fa	...
You	meant	...
Alexandre	?
Yes	,	of	course	!
--------------------
This	is	ridiculous	!
You	scared	the	life	out	of	me	!
How	'd	you	know	I	was	here	?
I	didn	't	.
Alexandre	and	I	wanted	a	place	where	we	wouldn	't	run	into	you	.
So	you	thought	I	meant	...
While	I	was	away	,	then	,	you	and	Fabien	...
You	don	't	waste	time	!
Moved	right	in	!
Fabien	!
--------------------
Alexandre	!
Come	here	!
And	I	thought	I	was	in	your	way	!
Forgive	me	,	Lea	.
I	can	explain	...
I	got	my	revenge	!
Sorry	I	'm	late	.
Traffic	...
Doesn	't	matter	.
We	're	off	tomorrow	.
--------------------
So	are	we	.
Sardinia	?
Brittany	.
Have	a	good	vacation	.
You	too	.
Why	'd	I	worry	about	you	?
Or	I	about	you	?
Have	a	good	trip	.

Is	it	a	good	thing	or	a	bad	thing	that	it	's	becoming	harder	maybe	impossible	to	encapsulate	information	in	discrete	units	and	sell	them	?
The	simplistic	answer	,	the	answer	that	you	get	from	Hollywood	and	the	recording	industry	is	-	it	's	a	disaster	.
This	is	not	a	film	about	piracy	.
The	recording	industry	's	been	freaked	out	.
The	movie	industry	's	been	freaked	out	.
The	suits	don	't	know	how	to	think	about	this	.
This	is	not	a	film	about	sharing	files	.
They	put	a	lot	of	money	into	making	those	movies	making	that	music	.
--------------------
So	they	want	to	get	something	back	.	but	the	way	they	're	trying	to	stop	the	copying	now	it	's	definitely	not	working	.
It	's	a	film	that	explores	massive	changes	in	the	way	we	produce	distribute	and	consume	media	.
Ever	since	Napster	,	the	music	industry	has	been	trying	to	kill	file	sharing
Napster	was	this	huge	global	party	of	everybody	suddenly	had	access	to	the	largest	music	library	in	the	world	.
And	what	'd	they	do	?
Well	,	they	went	after	Napster	and	they	shut	it	down	.
Napster	,	Aimster	,	Audiogalaxy	.
Grokster	.
IMash	-	Kazaa
All	of	these	companies	were	sued	.
--------------------
And	in	the	end	-	essentially	-	the	entertainment	industry	succeeded	in	driving	that	technology	out	of	the	mainstream	commercial	field	.
The	industry	's	turned	to	suing	individuals	,	hundreds	of	individuals	ultimately	thousands	,	now	tens	of	thousands	of	individuals	for	downloading	music	without	permission	.
Existing	players	are	trying	to	make	certain	things	happen	that	in	retrospect	will	seem	kind	of	barbaric	.
If	you	're	talking	about	the	distribution	of	cultural	material	,	of	music	and	cinema	,	well	there	is	a	long	history	of	whatever	the	incumbent	industry	happens	to	be	,	resisting	whatever	new	technology	provides	.
Cable	television	in	the	70	's	was	viewed	really	as	a	pirate	medium	.
All	the	television	networks	felt	that	taking	their	content	and	putting	it	on	cables	that	ran	to	peoples	houses	was	piracy	pure	and	simple	.
The	video	recorder	was	very	strongly	resisted	by	Hollywood	.
There	were	lawsuits	immediately	brought	by	the	movie	studios	who	felt	in	fact	,	who	said	publicly	that	the	VCR	was	to	the	American	movie	industry	what	the	"	Boston	Strangler	"	was	to	a	woman	alone	.
New	information	technologies	provide	Hollywood	and	the	recording	industries	with	fresh	channels	on	which	to	sell	products	,	but	they	can	also	open	unplanned	possibilities	for	their	consumers	.
The	sheet	music	people	resisted	the	recordings	.
--------------------
The	first	mp-	3	player	by	Diamond-	Rio	sort	of	the	initial	company
long	before	the	iPod	,	they	were	met	with	a	lawsuit	.
The	possibilities	suggested	by	Peer-	to-	Peer	technologies	have	prompted	the	entertainment	industries	to	react	in	an	unprecedented	way	.
Traditionally	,	copyright	infringement	has	just	been	a	civil	matter	.
If	a	copyright	owner	catches	you	doing	something	wrong	,	they	can	sue	you	and	force	you	to	pay	them	money	.
Criminal	infringement	liability	,	the	ability	to	prosecute	you	and	throw	you	in	jail	,	has	been	reserved	for	circumstances	of	commercial	piracy	,	circumstances	where	someone	has	made	500	copies	,	is	selling	them	on	the	street	as	competition	for	the	real	thing	.
Well	,	in	recent	years	,	copyright	owners	have	not	been	satisfied	with	that	.
They	've	wanted	to	reach	out	and	have	criminal	recourse	against	people	who	are	engaged	in	non-	commercial	activities	.
We	recognize	and	we	know	that	we	will	never	stop	piracy	.
Never	.
--------------------
We	just	have	to	try	to	make	it	as	difficult	and	as	tedious	as	possible	.
And	we	have	to	let	people	know	there	are	consequences	.
If	they	're	caught	.
What	they	've	sought	to	do	,	is	sue	a	few	people	.
Punish	them	severely	enough	that	they	can	essentially	intimidate	a	large	number	of	other	people	.
It	's	really	as	though	they	decided	to	intimidate	the	village	they	would	just	chop	of	the	heads	of	a	few	villagers	,	mount	those	heads	on	pikes	as	a	warning	to	everyone	else	.
The	fact	that	the	DVD	right	to	own	is	the	new	weapon	of	mass	destruction	in	the	world	is	primarily	for	the	fact	that	a	50	billion	dollar	film	can	be	reproduced	at	the	cost	of	literally	10	or	15	cents	.
There	is	a	fantastic	quote	by	Mark	Ghetty	,	who	is	the	owner	of	Ghetty	Images	,	which	is	a	huge	corporate	image	database	,	and	he	's	one	of	the	largest	intellectual	proprietors	in	the	world	.
He	once	said	intellectual	property	is	the	oil	of	the	21st	century	.
It	'a	a	fantastic	quote	,	you	could	condense	it	to	one	word	that	is	,	war	.
--------------------
He	declared	war	with	that	saying	we	will	fight	for	this	stuff	these	completely	hallucinatory	rights	to	images	,	ideas	,	texts	thoughts	,	inventions
Just	as	we	're	fighting	now	for	access	to	natural	resources	.
He	declared	war	.
Strange	kind	of	war	.
I	would	take	it	serious	.
But	it	's	ridiculous	and	serious	at	the	same	time	.
This	is	not	the	first	war	that	has	been	fought	over	the	production	,	reproduction	and	distribution	of	information	.
People	like	to	see	the	contemporary	and	the	digital	era	as	some	kind	of	a	unique	break	.
And	I	think	the	important	point	to	make	here	is	not	to	see	it	as	a	unique	break	,	but	really	to	see	it	as	a	moment	which	accelerates	things	that	have	already	happened	in	the	past	.
Before	the	arrival	of	the	printing	press	in	Europe	in	the	1500	's	,	information	was	highly	scarce	and	relatively	easy	to	control	.
--------------------
For	thousands	of	years	,	the	scribal	culture	really	hand-	picked	the	people	who	were	given	this	code	to	transmit	knowledge	across	time	and	space	.
It	's	an	economy	of	scarcity	that	you	're	dealing	with
People	are	starved	in	a	sense	for	more	books
There	are	images	from	the	16th	century	of	books	that	were	chained	,	and	had	to	be	guarded	by	armed	guards	outside	a	heavy	,	heavy	door	because	it	was	very	,	very	dangerous	for	people	to	have	access	to	that	.
Print	brought	with	it	a	new	abundance	of	information	threatening	the	control	over	ideas	that	had	come	with	scarcity	.
Daniel	Defoe	tells	of	Gutenberg	's	partner	Johann	Fust	,	arriving	in	15th	century	Paris	with	a	wagon	load	of	printed	bibles	.
When	the	bibles	were	examined	,	and	the	exact	similarity	of	each	book	was	discovered	,	the	Parisians	set	upon	Fust	accusing	him	of	black	magic	.
About	to	change	everything	,	this	new	communications	technology	was	seen	as	the	unholy	work	of	the	Devil	.
All	of	the	emerging	nation-	states	of
Europe	made	it	very	clear	that	they	would	control	information	flows	to	the	best	of	their	ability	.
--------------------
The	printers	were	the	ones	who	were	hunted	down	if	they	printed	the	forbidden	text	.
So	,	more	than	we	think	of	persecuting	the	authors	but	it	was	really	the	printers	who	suffered	most	.
As	print	technology	developed	in	Europe	and	America	its	pivotal	social	role	became	clear	.
Printing	becomes	associated	with	rebellion	and	emancipation	.
There	's	the	governor	of	Virginia	,	Governor	Berkeley	who	wrote	to	his	overseers	in	England	in	the	17th	century	saying	,	"	Thank	God	we	have	no	printing	in	Virginia	,	"
"	and	we	shall	never	have	it	as	long	as	I	'm	governor	.	"
This	was	a	reaction	to	the	English	civil	war	and	the	pamphlet	wars	and	they	were	called	paper	bullets	in	that	period	.
The	basic	idea	of	censorship	in	18th	century	France	is	a	concept	of	privilege	,	or	private	law	.
A	publisher	gets	the	right	to	publish	a	particular	text	,	that	is	deny	it	to	others	,	so	he	has	that	privilege	.
What	you	have	is	a	centralized	administration	for	controlling	the	book	trade	,	using	censorship	and	also	using	the	monopoly	of	the	established	publishers	.
--------------------
They	made	sure	that	the	books	that	flowed	throughout	a	society	were	authorized	-	were	the	authorized	editions	-	but	also	were	within	the	control	of	the	state	within	the	control	of	the	king	or	the	prince	.
You	had	a	very	elaborate	system	of	censorship	but	in	addition	to	that	you	had	a	monopoly	of	production	in	the	booksellers	'	guild	in	Paris	.
It	had	police	powers	.
And	then	the	police	itself	had	specialized	inspectors	of	the	book	trade	.
So	you	put	all	of	that	together	and	the	state	was	very	powerful	in	its	attempt	to	control	the	printed	word	.
Bot	not	only	was	this	apparatus	incapable	of	preventing	the	spread	of	revolutionary	thought	,	it	's	very	existence	inspired	the	creation	of	new	,	parallel	pirate	systems	of	distribution	.
What	is	clear	is	that	during	the	18th	century	the	printed	word	as	a	force	is	just	expanding	everywhere
You	've	got	publishing	houses	printing	presses	that	surround	France	in	what	I	call	a	"	fertile	crescent	"	dozens	and	dozens	of	them	producing	books	which	are	smuggled	across	the	French	borders	distributed	everywhere	in	the	kingdom	by	an	underground	system	.
I	have	a	case	of	one	Dutch	printer	who	looked	at	the	index	of	prohibited	books	and	used	it	for	his	publication	program	because	he	knew	these	were	titles	that	would	sell	well	.
The	pirates	had	agents	in	Paris	and	everywhere	else	who	were	sending	them	sheets	of	new	books	,	which	they	think	will	sell	well	.
--------------------
The	pirates	are	systematically	doing	I	use	the	word	,	it	's	an	anachronism	market	research	.
They	do	it	I	've	seen	it	in	hundreds	and	literally	thousands	of	letters	.
They	are	sounding	the	market	.
They	want	to	know	what	demand	is	.
And	so	the	reaction	on	the	part	of	the	publishers	at	the	center	is	,	of	course	,	extremely	hostile	.
And	,	I	've	read	a	lot	of	their	letters	.
They	're	full	of	expressions	like	buccaneer	and	private	and
"	people	without	shame	or	morality	"	etc	..
In	actual	fact	,	many	of	these	pirates	were	good	bourgeois	in	Lausanne	or	Geneva	or	Amsterdam	and	they	thought	that	they	were	just	doing	business	.
After	all	,	there	was	no	international	copyright	law	and	they	were	satisfying	demand	.
--------------------
There	were	printers	that	were	almost	holes	in	the	wall	or	down	in	the	-	if	they	were	printing	subversive	material	they	could	sort	of	hide	their	presses	very	quickly	.
People	used	to	put	them	on	rafts	and	float	down	to	another	town	if	they	were	in	trouble	with	the	authorities	.
It	was	very	movable	.
In	effect	,	you	've	got	two	systems	at	war	with	one	another	.
And	it	's	this	system	of	production	outside	of	France	that	is	crucial	for	the	Enlightenment	.
Not	only	did	this	new	media	system	spread	the	Enlightenment	,	but
I	won	't	use	the	word	prepared	the	way	for	the	Revolution	.
It	so	indicted	the	Old	Regime	that	this	power	-	public	opinion	became	crucial	in	the	collapse	of	the	government	in	1787-	1788
In	Paris	,	the	Bastille	had	been	a	prison	for	pirates	.
But	in	the	years	before	the	Revolution	the	authorities	gave	up	trying	to	imprison	pirates	.
--------------------
The	flow	of	ideas	and	information	was	too	strong	to	be	stopped	.
And	I	think	that	's	the	dramatic	change	that	was	affected	by	the	printing	revolution	That	all	of	a	sudden	the	emergence	of	a	new	reading	public	the	emergence	of	an	undisciplined	reading	public	which	were	not	subject	to	the	same	norms	of	reading	or	the	same	norms	of	relation	to	knowledge	as	it	was	in	the	past	.
It	was	a	dramatic	shift	.
The	fundamental	urge	to	copy	had	nothing	to	do	with	technology	.
It	's	about	how	culture	is	created	.
But	technology	of	course	changes	what	we	can	copy	how	quickly	we	can	copy	and	how	we	can	share	it	.
What	happens	when	a	copying	mechanism	is	invented	?
And	you	can	take	the	printing	press	or	you	can	take	bittorrent	.
It	shapes	people	's	habits	.
It	gives	people	completely	new	ideas	how	they	could	work	how	they	could	work	together	how	they	could	share	what	they	could	relate	to	what	their	lives	could	be	.
--------------------
There	's	no	way	that	an	absolutist	political	system	can	totally	suppress	the	spread	of	information	.
New	media	adapt	themselves	to	these	circumstances	.
And	often	,	they	can	become	even	more	effective	because	of	the	repression	.
Why	should	improvements	in	our	capacity	to	copy	be	linked	to	social	change	?
Because	communicating	so	fundamental	to	what	we	do	in	the	world	is	itself	and	act	of	copying	.
The	one	technique	that	brought	us	to	where	we	are	is	copying	.
Sharing	is	at	the	heart	of	in	some	senses	,	existence	.
Communication	,	the	need	to	talk	to	someone	,	is	an	act	of	sharing	.
The	need	to	listen	to	someone	is	an	act	of	sharing	.
Why	do	we	share	our	culture	?
--------------------
Why	do	we	share	language	?
Because	we	imitate	each	other	.
This	is	how	we	learn	to	speak	.
This	is	how	a	baby	learns	.
This	is	how	new	things	come	into	society	and	spread	through	society	.
Basically	what	keeps	us	together	is	that	we	copy	from	each	other	.
When	the	spoken	word	was	our	only	means	of	communication	,	we	traveled	far	and	wide	to	deliver	it	to	others	.
Later	,	as	we	began	to	communicate	in	written	form	,
Armies	of	scribes	multiplied	our	ideas	.
Our	urge	to	communicate	is	so	strong	that	we	have	always	pushed	the	tools	available	to	us	to	the	limit	.	then	gone	beyond	them	,	creating	new	technologies	that	reproduce	our	ideas	on	previously	unimaginable	scales	.
--------------------
In	1957	,	the	USSR	launched	Sputnik	.
In	response	,	the	American	government	authorized	massive	blue-	sky	spending	on	science	and	technology	overseen	by	a	new
Advanced	Research	Projects	Agency
It	was	ARPA	developing	the	ideas	of	visionary	computer	scientist	Joseph	Licklider	.	that	came	up	with	the	concept	of	networking	computers	.
It	's	been	hard	to	share	information	.
For	years	.
The	printing	press	of	course	was	the	great	step	into	sharing	information	.
And	we	have	been	needing	for	a	long	time	some	better	way	to	distribute	information	than	to	carry	it	about	.
The	print	on	paper	form	is	embarrassing	because	in	order	to	distribute	it	you	've	got	to	move	the	paper	around
And	lots	of	paper	gets	to	be	bulky	and	heavy	and	expensive	to	move	about	.
--------------------
The	ARPAnet	was	designed	to	allow	scientists	to	share	computer	resources	in	order	to	improve	innovation	.
To	make	this	vision	work	,
ARPAnet	had	to	allow	each	machine	on	the	network	to	reproduce	and	relay	the	information	sent	by	any	other	.
A	network	in	which	peers	shared	resources	equally	was	part	of	a	massive	shift	from	the	corporate	and	commercial	communications	systems	of	the	past	-	in	which	messages	radiated	from	a	central	point	or	down	through	a	hierarchy	.
There	was	no	center
And	no	machine	was	more	important	than	another
Anyone	could	join	the	network	,	provide	they	agreed	to	abide	by	the	rules	,	or	protocols	on	which	it	operated	.
Ever	since	,	really	,	the	60	's	onwards	packet	switch	networks	are	the	predominant	style	of	communications	used	today	.
Increasingly	so	in	both	voice	and	data	.
The	western	world	was	transforming	itself	from	the	rigid	production	systems	of	Fordism	to	fluid	work	,	lean	production	and	just-	in-	time	delivery	.
--------------------
A	post-	centralized	,	friction-	free	economy	needed	a	a	communications	system	just	like	this	.
We	didn	't	build	in	the	1970	's	networks	of	hierarchs	.
The	computers	that	existed	in	the	world	were	all	multimillion-	dollar	machines	and	they	basically	related	to	one	another	in	very	equal	ways	.
One	of	the	really	important	characteristics	of	the	internet	is	that	it	's	extremely	decentralized	and	that	the	services	on	the	internet	are	invented	and	operated	by	other	network	users
You	know	the	network	is	built	so	that	there	's	nobody	in	charge	that	everybody	has	control	over	their	own	communications	.
In	relying	on	the	internet	,	society	was	bringing	into	its	very	center	a	machine	whose	primary	function	was	the	reproduction	and	distribution	of	information	.
It	's	an	inherent	function	of	the	networks	that	we	use	today	that	this	data	is	stored	,	copied	,	stored	,	copied	normally	transient	,	normally	very	fast	,	you	know	,	in	milliseconds	micorseconds	specialized	pieces	of	equipment	such	as	switchers	,	routers	,	hubs	etc	.
Do	this	all	in	the	blink	of	an	eye	but	it	's	the	way	networks	WORK	.
What	ARPA	's	engineers	had	produced	was	the	blueprint	for	a	massive	copying	machine	without	master	.	which	would	grow	at	a	fantastic	rate	into	today	's	internet
So	this	entire	area	is	bristling	with	information	transfer	of	one	type	or	another
--------------------
For	instance	the	local	council	,	Tower	Hamlets	and	Hackney	we	're	sort	of	on	the	border	here	have	some	of	the	surveillance	traffic	and	security	cameras	linked	via	wireless	networks	themselves	.
The	spectrum	environment	is	getting	very	dirty	,	or	noisy
Every	single	packet	that	flies	through	the	multitude	of	wireless	networks	and	through	the	internet	is	listened	for	stored	in	memory	and	retransmitted	,	ie	it	's	copied	from	one	,	what	's	called	network	segment	,	to	the	next	our	immediate	environment	now	,	our	immediate	ecosphere	is	so	broad	,	so	large	that	you	cannot	contain	information	very	easily	anymore	,	you	cannot	stop	or	censor	information	or	stop	the	transmission	once	it	's	out	there	It	's	like	water	through	your	hands
It	's	like	trying	to	stop	a	dam	from	bursting	.
I	would	say	right	now	,	we	are	likely	in	range	of	wireless	microwave	radio	transmissions	that	are	most	likely	breaching	some	sort	of	copyright	law	right	at	this	moment	.
To	try	on	the	back	of	modernism	and	all	this	international	law	to	make	profit	out	of	his	own	ungenerosity	to	humankind	.
One	of	the	main	battlegrounds	in	law	,	in	technology	now	is	the	extent	to	which	it	is	possible	to	exclude	people	from	information	,	knowledge	and	cultural	goods	the	extent	to	which	it	's	possible	to	enclose	a	bit	-	if	you	will	of	culture	,	and	say	it	's	in	a	container	you	have	to	pay	me	in	order	to	access	it	.
You	can	make	something	property	if	you	can	build	a	fence	for	it	,	you	can	enclose	something	,	if	you	can	build	a	wall	around	it	.
In	the	American	west	,	the	range	land	was	free	,	and	all	could	graze	it	because	it	was	too	expensive	to	fence	it	barbed	wire	changed	that	and	you	could	turn	it	into	property	.
Culture	came	in	these	boxes	.
--------------------
Control	came	naturally	as	part	of	the	process	of	the	existence	of	the	medium	itself	.
There	's	a	thing	,	a	book	a	record	a	film	that	you	can	hold	onto	and	not	give	somebody	else	or	you	can	give	it	to	them	.
And	the	whole	payment	system	was	built	around	:
Do	I	give	you	this	unit	of	information	?	or	don	't	I	give	it	to	you	?
And	that	was	how	the	whole	model	of	copyright	was	built	from	the	book	on	up	.
What	used	to	be	property	-	music	,	cinema	-	now	becomes	very	,	very	easy	to	transmit	across	barriers	.
We	have	today	the	ability	to	make	copies	and	distribute	copies	inexpensively	.
If	one	copy	leaks	out	on	the	internet	very	rapidly	it	's	available	to	everyone	.
One	can	always	try	to	create	artificial	boundaries	,	technological	boundaries	which	prevent	us	from	sharing	files	prevent	us	from	sharing	music	etc	.
But	how	do	you	create	a	wall	or	a	boundary	against	the	very	basic	desire	of	sharing	?
--------------------
I	think	the	war	on	piracy	is	failing	for	social	reasons	.
People	like	to	communicate	.
People	like	to	do	,	to	share	things	.
People	like	to	transform	things	and	technology	makes	it	so	easy	that	there	's	no	way	of	stopping	it	.
The	new	generation	is	just	copying	stuff	out	of	the	internet	.
It	's	the	way	they	're	brought	up	.
They	started	with	Napster	music	is	free	to	them	.
They	don	't	consider	music	being	something	you	pay	for	.
They	pay	for	clothes	.
They	pay	for	stuff	they	can	touch	.
--------------------
Intellectual	property	is	-	What	the	fuck	is	that	?
I	've	never	bought	a	piece	of	music	in	my	life	.
We	don	't	think	it	's	illegal	'	cos	everyone	's	doing	it	.
We	can	't	really	be	blamed	for	just	downloading	something	that	's	already	on	the	internet	.
People	think	it	's	legal
'	cos	it	's	like	copying	,	like	,	without	the	copyright	or	something	.
If	it	's	a	crime	,	why	put	it	on	there	?
So	whether	you	're	using	a	long-	lost	peer-	to-	peer	system	,	like	the	original	Napster	,	or	you	're	using	Gnutella	,	or	you	're	using	bittorrent	the	principle	here	is	that	you	are	actually	engaging	in	internet	communication	as	it	was	originally	designed	,	you	are	able	to	serve	content	as	well	as	consume	.
Especially	after	the	Napster	lawsuit	we	saw	an	emergence	of	a	lot	of	more	decentralized	file-	sharing	services	.
Computer	programs	that	people	could	run	on	their	own	computers	that	would	make	them	part	of	the	network	,	without	having	any	one	place	where	there	's	a	master	list	or	a	master	coordination	.
--------------------
What	this	means	is	that	in	fighting	file	sharing	the	entertainment	industry	is	fighting	the	fundamental	structure	of	the	internet	.
Short	of	redesigning	and	re-	engineering	either	the	internet	or	the	devices	we	use	to	interact	with	the	internet	,	there	's	nothing	that	Hollywood	or
Washington	or	Brussels	or	Geneva	can	do	anything	about	.
They	shattered	Napster	into	millions	of	little	pieces	,	spread	across	computers	all	around	the	globe	and	now	if	you	want	to	shut	it	down	,	you	have	to	track	down	every	single	one	of	them	and	turn	it	off	.
And	they	just	can	't	do	that	.
They	send	out	letters	every	month	trying	to	shut	down	a	couple	here	and	there	but	it	just	doesn	't	work	.
There	are	just	too	many	.
It	's	out	of	the	bag	now	.
Once	it	's	that	far	distributed	,	it	's	really	going	to	be	hopeless	.
You	can	sue	people	forever	.
--------------------
You	can	sue	a	handful	of	college	students	,	university	students	in	the	United	States
You	can	sue	the	investors	of	Napster	.	-	and	Napster	-	You	can	sue	the	company	that	provided	the	software	for	Kazaa	.
But	it	doesn	't	shut	anything	down	.
We	recognize	and	we	know	that	we	will	never	stop	piracy	.
Kazaa	lost	a	big	case	in	the	United	States	in	the	Supreme	Court	.
Kazaa	and	Grokster	and	a	set	of	other	companies	.
So	those	companies	no	longer	operate	.
But	the	network	still	works	,	in	other	words	,	the	interface	is	still	installed	on	millions	of	computers	and	people	still	use	them	.	never	stop	piracy
The	music	industry	,	if	they	want	to	stop	file	sharing	,	there	's	no	central	computer	for	them	to	go	to	and	shut	it	down	.
They	have	to	go	all	the	way	to	the	ends	of	every	wire	.
--------------------
They	have	to	snip	all	the	cords	across	the	globe	.
So	when	the	Pirate	Bay	got	shut	down
last	year	,	and	during	the	raid
Amsterdam	Information	Exchange	,	AM6	reported	that	35	%	of	all	the	European	internet	traffic	just	vanished	in	a	couple	of	hours
The	files	have	been	shared	.
There	's	no	way	back	.
You	can	't	-	it	's	not	about	shutting	down	bittorrent	it	would	be	about	confiscating	everyone	's	hard	drives	.
The	files	are	out	there	.
They	have	been	downloaded	.
They	're	down	,	there	's	no	up	anymore	.
--------------------
They	're	all	down	.	never	never	never
There	's	nobody	you	can	go	to	and	say	:
Shut	down	the	file	sharing	.
The	internet	's	just	not	built	that	way	.
We	're	surrounded	by	images	.
Every	day	,	everywhere	.
There	's	nothing	you	can	do	about	it	.
But	the	problem	with	these	images	is	that	they	're	not	yours
People	's	lives	are	determined	by	images	that	they	have	no	rights	to	whatsoever	,	and	that	's	-	I	'd	say	it	's	a	very	unfortunate	situation	.
There	's	this	work	of	mine	that	people	have	described	as	a	series	of	unattainable	women	,	in	fact	it	's	a	series	of	unattainable	images	.
--------------------
The	one	last	mission	of	cinema	is	to	make	sure	that	images	are	not	seen	.
That	's	why	we	have	DRM	-	copy	protection	-	rights	management	region	coding	,	all	that	stuff	but	if	an	image	is	seen	then	it	tells	you	one	thing	:	it	's	not	your	image	it	's	their	image	.
It	's	none	of	your	business	.
Don	't	copy	it	.
Don	't	modify	it	.
Just	forget	about	it	.
You	can	't	just	say	-	hey	it	's	just	a	movie
It	is	reality	.
It	's	a	very	specific	reality	of	properties	.
Radio	.
--------------------
Television	.
Newspapers	.
Film	.
At	the	heart	of	all	of	them	there	is	a	very	clear	distinction	between	the	producer	and	the	consumer	.
And	the	idea	is	a	very	,	very	static	one	.
That	here	is	a	technology	that	allows	me	to	communicate	to	you	.
But	it	's	not	really	a	conversation	that	one	has	in	mind	.
It	use	to	be	,	if	you	had	a	radio	station	or	television	station	or	a	printing	press	.
You	could	broadcast	your	views	to	a	very	large	number	of	people	at	quite	a	bit	of	expense	and	a	fairly	small	percentage	of	the	population	was	able	to	do	that	.
The	materials	were	produced	by	some	set	of	professional	commercial	producers	,	who	then	controlled	the	experience	and	located	individuals	at	the	passive	receiving	end	of	the	cultural	conversation	.
--------------------
I	'm	John	Wayne	.
We	believe	in	many	things	but	I	'm	John	Wayne	.
If	you	wanted	to	change	the	way	the	television	broadcast	network	works	-	good	luck	you	're	going	to	have	to	get	the	majority	of	the	shareholders	to	agree	with	you	-	or	you	're	going	to	have	to	replace	some	very	expensive	equipment	.
In	the	world	of	that	universe	where	you	needed	to	get	distribution	there	were	gatekeepers	that	stood	in	your	way	.
I	know	that	there	's	gatekeepers	out	there	at	every	level	by	the	way	certainly	production	,	funding	,	exhibition	.
They	can	get	fucked	as	far	as	I	'm	concerned	.
You	would	need	to	satisfy	the	lawyer	for	the	network	or	the	lawyer	for	the	television	station	or	radio	station	that	what	you	've	done	is
legal	and	cleared	and	permissions	have	been	obtained	-	and	probably	insurance	has	been	obtained	before	you	could	get	into	the	channels	of	mass	media	communication	.
The	number	of	people	who	could	actively	speak	was	relatively	small	and	they	were	organized	around	one	of	the	only	two	models	we	had	in	the	industrial	period	to	collect	enough	physical	capital	necessary	to	communicate	either	the	state	or	the	market	usually	based	on	advertising	.
This	is	the	question	that	faces	us	today	.
--------------------
If	the	battle	against	sharing	is	already	lost	-	and	media	is	no	longer	a	commodity	-	how	will	society	change	?
Those	whose	permission	was	required	are	resisting	this	transition	because	control	is	a	good	thing	to	get	if	you	can	get	it	.
The	control	that	used	to	reside	in	the	very	making	of	the	artifact	is	up	for	grabs	.
Should	we	expect	changes	as	massive	as	those	of	the	printing	press	?
There	's	plenty	of	people	who	are	watching	,	you	know	,	the	worst	kind	of	Soap	Opera	right	now	they	're	a	planet	and	I	can	't	save	them	.
As	hard	as	I	've	tried	,	I	can	't	save	them	.
But	do	we	need	saving	?
Will	there	still	be	a	mass-	produced	and	mass-	oriented	media	from	which	to	save	us	?
Music	didn	't	begin	with	the	phonograph	and	it	won	't	end	with	the	peer-	to-	peer	network	.
alright	,	listen	man	,	I	couldn	't	give	a	shit	if	you	're	older	this	young	'n'	s	bin	colder	give	it	ten	years	then	I	'm	going	to	be	known	as	a	better	than	older	I	swear	now	people	stayin	colder	so	don	'	try	n	tell	me	your	older	you	could	be	roller	or	be	more	music	mix	tapes	promos	and	everythings	out	there	,	so	don	't	try	tell	me	I	don	't
--------------------
The	panic	of	the	movie	industry	and	the	music	industry	is	that	people	could	actually	start	to	produce	and	that	file	sharing	networks	-	file	sharing	technology	enables	them	to	produce	stuff	.
To	do	this	I	'm	colder	better	than	most	out	older
I	take	out	any	that	are	younger	diss	me	,	are	you	dumb	you	're	an	idiot	you	will	never	get	this	chip	of	your	shoulder	this	kid	's	colder	than	you	were	when	you	were	this	age	[	...	]	please	don	't	play	-	why	you	can	't	see	that	playtime	's	over	.	playtime	's	over	-	since	year	six	i	been	a	playground	soldier	dem	days	were	lyrical	dat	lyrical	G	but	now	everything	is	colder	now	there	's	content	flows	and	everything	-	mix	tape	promos	everything	-	who	'd	you	name	your	favorite	MC	,	I	'll	write	the	sixteen	make	him	look	like	...
People	have	lamented	much	the	death	of	the	author	what	we	're	witnessing	now	is	far	beyond
It	's	the	becoming	producer	of	former	consumers	.	and	that	suggests	a	new	economic	model	for	society	.	why	?	cos	I	'm	going	on	show	I	move	fast	-	goin	on	show
like	your	team	be	out	for	the	ratings	by	my	team	be	out	for	the	do(	ugh	)	in	the	air	tha	show	-	eh	what	we	're	goin	on	show	so	your	put	man	pay	me	-	I	'm	doin	no	less	I	got	the	vibes	,	that	run	down	the	show
It	's	not	so	much	the	fact	that	the	Phantom	Menace	is	downloaded	500	times	,	or	600	times	etc	.
Yeah	of	course	,	there	is	an	imaginary	specter	of	economic	loss	that	informs	that	but	the	real	battle	or	the	real	threat
lays	in	a	shift	in	the	ways	that	we	think	of	the	possibilities	of	ourselves	as	creators	and	not	merely	as	consumers	.
It	's	like	a	whole	network
--------------------
This	is	something	that	I	've	given	out	and	I	've	let	people	download	it	and	they	can	download	it	,	do	what	they	want	I	've	made	a	blog	about	it	saying	oh	look	,	DJs	you	can	play	this	where	you	want
There	's	this	guy	in	Brooklyn	and	he	's	just	done	a	remix	of	it	,	just	like	-	It	's	totally	different	to	what	I	thought	but
He	's	just	-	this	guy	from	Brooklyn	and	I	really	respect	that	he	came	back	to	me	and	said	look	and	it	's	going	on	his	mix	album	.
One	of	the	things	that	intrigues	me	tremendously	about	the	proliferation	of	material	that	's	out	there	in	the	world	for	people	to	grab	,	is	the	potential	creation	of	millions	of	new	authors	.
Thanks	to	the	internet	,	thanks	to	digital	technologies	the	gatekeepers	have	really	been	removed	.
People	can	take	more	of	their	cultural	environment	make	it	their	own	use	it	as	found	materials	to	put	together	their	own	expressions	do	their	own	research	,	create	their	own	communications	,	create	their	own	communities	when	they	need	collaboration	with	others	rather	than	relying	on	a	limited	set	of	existing	institutions	or	on	a	set	of	materials	that	they	're	not	allowed	to	use	without	going	and	asking
Please	may	I	use	this	?
Please	may	I	create	?
Basically	,	in	terms	of	samples	not	many	people	go	out	of	their	way	to	clear	samples
Right	about	now	I	've	got	the	things	on	the	fruity	slicer	like	this	on	different	keys	it	's	just	different	parts	of	the	sample	actually	just	some	Turkish	shit	i	don	't	even	know	who	it	's	by	-	like	it	's	just	some	random	sample
--------------------
I	make	mainly	instrumentals	so	really	I	've	made	a	tool	for	that	to	sort	of	MC	to	anyway
It	's	good	that	people	are	ruthless	enough	to	use	another	person	's	tune	and	record	themselves	spittin	bars	over	it	.
Look	I	'm	takin	over	now	but	then	the	game	says	too	free	to	october	now
I	'm	fuckin	it	up	-	listen	it	's	over	now	i	'm	settin	the	pace	.	how	they	gonna	slow	me	down	?
look	-	it	's	over	clown
I	got	the	skippigest	flows	in	town	plus	-	you	niggas	can	't	fuck	wit	my	word	play	-	I	switch	it	back	-	DJ	bring	it	back
Sometimes	you	get	the	big	artists	freestylin	your	stuff	sort	of	put	it	out	there	on	their	CDs	and	you	don	't	even	know	about	it
We	live	in	this	world	in	which	absolute	abundance	of	information	is	an	everyday	fact	for	a	lot	of	us	and	this	means	we	have	a	certain	attitude	towards	the	idea	of	information	as	property	.
It	's	like	you	've	heard	,	sharing	is	in	our	blood	,	so	the	struggle	to	hold	on	to	knowledge	and	creativity	as	a	commodity	by	force	it	's	going	to	be	met	by	our	strong	urge	to	share	,	copy	and	cooperate	.
Kids	,	if	they	sample	my	music	to	make	their	music	,	that	would	be	another	good	thing	as	well	I	would	like	that	as	well
--------------------
I	want	them	to	do	that	.
If	I	made	an	old	tune	,	take	a	bit	from	it	,	drop	something	over	it	and	make	it	music	make	it	big	-	if	you	can	do	that	-	do	that	.
When	you	put	primary	materials	in	the	hands	of	ordinary	citizens	really	,	really	interesting	things	can	happen	.
I	ain	't	no	musician	-	I	just	know	how	to	make	things	sound	good
I	want	to	make	people	realize	their	own	value	-	I	want	them	to	realize	that	they	are	the	masters	of	their	own	content	,	that	they	are	they	create	something	,	they	can	share	it	if	someone	else	created	something	they	can	contribute	,	they	can	help	they	can	get	it	and	use	it	the	way	it	's	supposed	to	be	.
So	it	's	a	terrorism	of	the	mind	that	actually	sustains	concepts
like	intellectual	property	it	's	a	terrorism	that	's	grounded	on	an	idea	of	brutal	repression	of	that	which	is	actually	possible	.
If	everything	is	user-	generated	it	also	means	that	you	have	to	create	something	in	order	to	be	part	of	the	society	.
I	think	one	of	the	things	that	we	are	seeing	coming	out	is	culture	where	things	are	produced	because	people	care	about	it	and	not	necessarily	because	they	hope	other	people	will	buy	it	.
So	what	we	will	see	is	things	made	by	the	people	for	themselves	.
--------------------
I	don	't	think	I	know	a	person	who	just	listens	to	it	and	doesn	't	try	and	get	involved	in	some	way	by	producing	or	something
You	know	all	these	things	that	are	taking	the	copyright	industry	totally	by	surprise	-	and	they	're	scrambling	with	and	not	able	to	deal	with	-	for	the	next	generation	it	's	just	part	of	the	media	landscape
They	're	natives	,	they	're	natives	in	that	media	landscape	absolutely	.
And	they	're	not	alone	.
I	think	of	myself	as	a	pirate	.
We	are	pirates	.
I	'm	a	pirate
I	'm	proud	cos	I	get	my	music	free	so	it	's	alright	-	I	'm	proud
I	think	we	need	to	have	a	broad	conversation	-	it	's	probably	gonna	be	an	international	conversation	where	people	who	make	things	and	people	who	use	things	-	I	'm	talking	about	cultural	works	-	sit	together	and	think	about	what	kinds	of	rules	best	serve	these	interests	,	I	don	't	know	that	we	're	going	to	agree	,	but	I	think	we	need	to	ask	a	little	bit	more	about	utopia	we	need	to	really	figure	out	what	kind	of	a	world	we	'd	like	to	live	in	an	then	try	to	craft	regulations	to	match	that	-	being	reactive	doesn	't	cut	it	.
The	future	isn	't	clear	for	sure	but	that	's	why	we	're	here	,	we	're	trying	to	form	the	future	,	we	're	trying	to	make	it	the	way	we	want	it	-	but	obviously	most	people	want	it	to	be	and	that	's	why	we	're	doing	this	.
--------------------
Let	's	build	a	world	that	we	're	actually	gonna	be	proud	of	,	not	just	a	profitable	world	-	for	a	few	very	large	media	companies
Making	money	is	not	the	point	with	culture	,	or	media	-	making	something	is	the	point	with	media	,	and	I	don	't	think	that	people	will	stop	making	music	,	stop	making	movies	stop	making	-	taking	cool	photographs	-	whatever
Although	it	's	difficult	to	believe	it	now	,	we	can	do	without	the	entertainment	industries	,	we	'll	find	new	ways	to	get	the	stuff	we	want	made	-	we	want	a	world	in	which	we	can	share	,	work	together	and	find	new	ways	to	support	each	other	while	we	're	doing	it	.
This	is	the	world	we	're	tyring	to	bring	into	being	.
A	force	like	this	,	a	power	like	this	.
Zillions	of	people	connected	sharing	data	,	sharing	their	work	,	sharing	the	work	of	others	this	situation	is	unprecedented	in	human	history	,	and	it	is	a	force	that	will	not	be	stopped	.
People	always	ask	us	who	are	the	League	of	Noble	Peers	?
And	we	tell	them	,	you	are	.
I	am	.
Even	your	bank	manager	is	.
--------------------
That	's	why	I	'm	a	vague	blur	.
It	's	kind	of	like	:
Insert	yourself	here	.
Because	we	all	produce	information	now	,	we	all	reproduce	information	.
We	all	distribute	it	.
We	can	't	stop	ourselves	.
It	's	like	breathing	.
We	'll	do	it	as	long	as	we	're	alive	.
And	when	we	stop	doing	it	,	we	'll	be	dead	.

Oh	,	you	are	really	good	at	this	.
You	are	really	too	bad	.
Let	's	play	another	set	again	when	we	reach	Seoul	?
At	Seoul	too	?
There	's	no	need	for	us	to	meet	again	,	right	?
Yes	,	it	's	me	.
I	just	arrived	.
--------------------
Home	.
That	's	right	,	I	want	to	meet	you	as	well	.
But	I	'm	really	too	dirty	right	now	.
I	just	can	't	meet	you	looking	like	this	.
I	really	miss	you	till	my	eyes	are	popping	out	soon	.
This	is	not	exaggerated	.
Hey	,	didn	't	I	told	you	to	leave	?	!
No	matter	what	that	's	the	place	that	I	gave	my	youth	to	.
What	youth	?
Am	I	the	one	who	made	your	youth	disappear	?
--------------------
Then	just	go	tell	that	woman	if	you	want	to	talk	about	your	youth	.
For	a	fellow	who	gave	up	your	twenty	years	relationship	just	because	of	a	stupid	girl	.
Your	face	is	really	thick	.
Director	.
How	am	I	supposed	to	go	when	I	have	an	important	appointment	?
No	.
We	can	meet	anytime	since	we	are	living	in	the	same	district	.
Your	meal	order	is	here	!
The	meal	delivery	is	here	.
Bye	,	mom	.
--------------------
Son	..
Han	Kyul	.
Bye	.
The	door	is	open	.
Excuse	me	,	the	meal	delivery	is	here	.
Just	put	it	on	that	table	.
Yes	!
What	are	you	doing	?
Come	in	quickly	.
Yes	.
--------------------
Hey	,	is	that	cold	noodles	?
Right	.
Everyone	is	really	all	nude	today	.
All	nude	.
Is	mine	so	scary	?
All	day	,	starting	from	the	morning	,	both	women	and	men	.
All	nude	.
Ugh	!
Oh	,	my	legs	are	really	weak	.
He	has	been	staring	at	it	for	quite	a	long	time	.
--------------------
Hey	,	the	money	...
See	it	?
This	is	Teacher	's	magnificent	flying	kick	.
Hey	,	kids	.
Clap	!
Chan	!
Chan	!
Eun	Chan	,	something	big	happened	.
Well	,	that	Teacher	Go	...
Can	you	come	out	for	a	while	because	of	my	personal	private	matter	?
--------------------
The	wash	room	is	blocked	again	,	right	?
Teacher	,	it	'll	only	take	a	while	.
Practice	on	your	own	.
You	call	this	a	big	issue	?
I	can	do	it	later	.
How	can	you	ask	me	to	unclog	the	toilet	while	I	'm	teaching	the	kids	?
You	're	asking	me	to	clear	it	up	when	it	's	yours	?	!
The	amount	is	really	big	,	so	just	think	of	it	in	a	positive	way	.
Quit	complaining	,	really	.
Wouldn	't	it	be	better	to	just	do	your	business	a	little	at	a	time	?
--------------------
Listen	,	just	wait	until	you	get	to	my	age	.
See	if	you	can	go	a	little	at	a	time	.
Geez	.
I	heard	that	the	owner	has	put	your	dojang	(	martial	arts	hall	)	space	out	for	sale	.
The	taekwondo	place	...
You	know	the	place	where	you	go	like	...
You	know	the	dojang	,	right	?
Oh	my	,	this	is	really	.
Oh	,	it	's	mom	!
Oh	,	it	's	Noona	.
--------------------
New	shoes	.
Ahjussi	.
Mom	!
Mom	!
You	bought	a	new	pair	of	shoes	?
Wait	up	,	Mom	.
Wait	.
Hello	?
She	slipped	away	again	.
Oppa	!
--------------------
End	the	call	.
Mom	bought	another	pair	of	new	shoes	again	.
Gangster	?
Don	't	you	like	gangsters	?
So	what	's	the	problem	?
Where	did	she	go	?
Hey	,	who	is	he	?
What	tricks	are	you	trying	to	play	?
You	will	be	dead	if	you	sit	by	my	side	.
Eun	Sae	.
--------------------
What	?
Who	is	he	?
Hello	!
Eun	Chan	,	you	are	here	.
Hey	,	Go	Eun	Sae	.
Is	he	your	lover	?
My	heart	isn	't	feeling	too	well	now	.
I	can	understand	that	you	like	me	.
But	,	we	are	not	the	fated	ones	.
Didn	't	you	drop	out	during	high	school	?
--------------------
You	have	no	education	,	no	money	and	even	your	face	is	really	plain	.
Based	on	what	confidence	are	you	trying	so	hard	?
Can	't	you	see	how	much	I	love	you	?
You	are	my	angel	.
Go	Eun	Sae	.
I	know	.
But	compare	to	love	,	I	look	more	heavily	upon	conditions	.
Then	what	's	this	?
Are	you	saying	that	rascal	's	conditions	are	acceptable	?
We	don	't	ask	for	anything	.
--------------------
That	's	why	I	brought	them	here	on	my	own	.
Talk	so	much	...
What	kind	of	place	is	this	?
Oh	,	it	's	great	.
Hey	,	have	a	fight	with	me	.
Mr.	Hong	,	the	coffee	is	awesome	.
Oppa	,	let	's	settle	this	matter	quickly	.
So	that	we	can	go	home	.
What	?
Home	?
--------------------
What	are	you	doing	to	my	Eun	Sae	?
Are	you	co-	habiting	?
Are	you	not	letting	go	?	!
I	'm	not	letting	go	,	Rascal	.
Let	's	battle	it	out	.
Let	go	!
Stop	your	pretending	.
And	remember	this	.
The	guy	which	I	settled	three	years	ago	is	still	staying	in	the	emergency	ward	right	now	.
So	just	go	your	way	when	your	luck	is	still	good	.
--------------------
Rascal	,	you	are	really	.
You	really	don	't	get	what	I	'm	saying	.
I	'm	a	Taekwondo	teacher	.
I	was	a	judo	's	representative	in	the	past	.
A	Judo	representative	that	doesn	't	know	Judo	at	all	.
I	'm	the	parent	head	of	our	family	.
If	just	because	I	beat	up	a	fellow	like	you	.
And	lose	my	livelihood	after	getting	called	to	the	police	station	,	how	can	I	still	survive	?
I	have	no	strength	left	to	talk	to	you	as	I	'm	really	hungry	.
So	leave	quickly	instead	of	trying	to	debate	with	me	.
--------------------
If	not	,	do	you	want	to	have	a	battle	?
This	is	Prince	Coffee	,	I	would	like	to	order	a	set	of	black	sauce	noodles	.
Ahjussi	,	me	too	!
You	want	to	eat	as	well	?
Yes	,	yes	.
Thank	you	.
Prince	coffee	cafe	!
Black	sauce	noodles	with	additional	preserve	carrots	.
This	is	free	.
The	freebie	is	great	.
--------------------
It	's	really	good	that	there	are	these	too	.
Go	Eun	Sae	,	you	can	't	go	back	on	your	words	.
You	will	be	mine	if	I	manage	to	win	this	rascal	.
Do	you	have	the	noodle	money	?
Am	I	the	one	to	lose	?
You	will	be	the	one	.
Ahjussi	,	you	have	to	be	the	judge	.
Hey	,	you	must	finish	five	bowls	of	black	sauce	noodles	.
If	you	lose	,	you	will	have	to	pay	the	coffee	money	as	well	.
But	you	didn	't	say	that	just	now	.
--------------------
OK	.
OK	.
Ready	,	get	set	.
Start	!
Hey	,	how	can	you	still	have	any	left	over	?
You	should	eat	up	everything	.
Crab	meat	,	pizza	...
Pig	porridge	,	cooking	oil	,	vegetable	noodles	.
Plus-	filled	bloody	boil	on	the	back	of	a	pig	's	skin	.
Rotten	margarine	full	of	dung	flies	.
--------------------
Spaghetti	full	of	squirming	,	wiggling	worms	.
The	greasy	,	dirty	oil	from	the	pores	of	the	nose	.
Oh	,	really	.
The	black	sauce	noodles	are	not	good	at	all	.
I	only	have	one	more	left	.
Ahjussi	!
Please	give	me	some	more	of	the	sweet	carrots	!
Give	me	more	.
What	's	left	over	is	more	than	what	I	expected	.
Do	you	still	want	some	more	?
--------------------
Hey	,	the	restroom	is	over	there	!
Go	to	your	grandma	.
I	didn	't	even	want	to	come	over	either	.
Mom	and	Grandma	made	me	to	come	here	.
I	'll	stay	for	five	minutes	before	leaving	.
Do	you	really	don	't	want	to	see	me	that	much	?
So	you	didn	't	even	come	down	for	dinner	?
Has	the	Dad	spoken	to	Han	Kyul	yet	?
Have	you	figured	out	to	use	which	methods	to	deal	with	Han	Kyul	?
Yes	,	this	is	all	.
--------------------
But	I	still	feel	that	Han	Kyul	doesn	't	understand	your	situation	.
I	know	what	to	do	.
That	fellow	is	still	immature	.
He	will	faint	upon	hearing	that	I	have	cancer	.
Just	leave	it	.
It	's	already	enough	to	live	until	this	age	.
I	'm	a	person	that	won	't	have	any	regrets	even	if	I	die	tomorrow	.
I	have	already	lived	my	life	enough	.
But	I	'm	still	really	curious	.
I	understand	that	Han	Kyul	's	father	is	usually	reticent	.
--------------------
Han	Kyul	really	liked	his	dad	when	he	was	young	.
But	why	is	he	so	cold	to	him	right	now	?
I	thought	that	it	'll	better	when	time	passes	more	.
But	it	got	even	worse	day	after	day	.
Both	of	them	will	say	that	they	don	't	know	too	if	you	ask	them	.
I	asked	my	friends	and	they	said	that	all	men	are	like	that	.
How	can	it	be	like	that	?
Okay	,	everything	is	settled	.
Call	Han	Kyul	to	come	over	.
Why	are	your	expressions	like	that	?
--------------------
You	're	looking	pretty	swell	,	aren	't	you	!
Spending	my	money	without	care	,	you	've	been	having	fun	playing	around	for	five	years	.
You	couldn	't	have	possibly	played	less	even	though	it	's	been	five	years	,	right	?	!
It	's	so	good	.
I	finally	feel	that	I	have	already	come	home	when	I	heard	your	loud	voice	.
You	rascal	,	how	dare	you	use	your	flirting	strategies	on	me	!
I	let	you	go	overseas	to	learn	business	management	.
Then	why	is	your	film	investment	tottering	?	!
And	not	only	that	.
There	are	six	credit	card	fees	he	has	to	deal	with	.
--------------------
You	manipulating	little	boy	!
Now	you	're	toying	around	even	more	since	the	movie	world	was	not	enough	for	you	.
Didn	't	you	promise	that	you	will	come	back	before	thirty	?
I	'm	only	twenty-	nine	right	now	.
Grandma	.
Let	's	go	to	the	harbor	's	ice	bar	to	eat	that	shave	ice	that	we	had	before	.
What	,	shaved	ice	?
Oh	,	it	's	him	.
That	fellow	really	took	good	pictures	.
Why	is	this	doing	here	?
--------------------
Aren	't	you	both	in	love	with	each	other	?
Both	of	you	are	always	sticking	together	and	you	are	really	loving	.
This	was	taken	by	your	friend	who	lives	in	Seoho	.
Loving	?
Then	,	this	is	not	loving	?
You	,	rascal	.
You	really	have	such	a	good	image	in	front	of	your	Grandma	,	Mom	and	Dad	.
A	man	should	be	established	by	thirty	and	to	form	a	family	.
How	dare	you	go	around	smooching	with	a	boy	!
Get	married	immediately	!
--------------------
Then	should	I	go	on	a	match-	making	date	?
Would	that	do	?
But	the	girl	must	be	very	pretty	.
It	isn	't	all	for	me	.
It	's	for	your	great	grand	children	.
I	'm	back	!
Oh	,	you	worked	hard	.
I	'm	so	tired	.
Are	you	finished	with	the	arms	and	legs	?
I	haven	't	finished	today	's	yet	.
--------------------
I	just	returned	after	my	class	reunion	party	today	.
Those	shoes	earlier	...
Eun	Chan	,	those	are	not	expensive	at	all	.
Don	't	bother	.
It	's	already	considered	cheap	to	spend	$100	for	releasing	of	stress	.
What	are	we	to	do	when	it	's	mom	's	happiness	in	life	.
Why	do	you	have	so	much	rubbish	to	say	when	you	are	pooping	?
Is	$100	a	small	amount	?
Yes	,	of	course	it	's	not	small	.
I	also	know	that	this	is	not	petty	money	.
--------------------
And	so	,	I	'm	working	really	hard	right	now	regardless	of	the	corns	on	my	hands	.
Our	mom	,	there	won	't	be	a	need	to	treat	the	corns	if	you	were	to	save	up	a	little	.
You	are	thinking	of	saying	this	,	right	?
There	's	no	need	to	.
Don	't	say	anymore	when	you	are	a	basin	full	of	holes	.
Aren	't	you	going	to	study	?
Didn	't	you	said	that	you	are	going	to	college	?
I	'm	now	trying	to	increase	my	concentration	.
Mom	,	I	feel	that	my	brain	are	getting	better	by	sticking	these	.
She	is	really	too	into	it	.
--------------------
So	into	it	,	that	she	has	became	cross-	eyed	.
I	feel	that	I	become	cross-	eyed	myself	when	I	looked	too	long	at	her	.
Hello	?
Oh	!
Hi	Dong	Sook	!
Of	course	,	I	came	back	peacefully	.
What	,	the	ring	?
The	ring	,	I	'm	wearing	it	.
Huh	?
Where	did	it	go	?
--------------------
No	,	it	's	really	strange	.
In	the	room	,	I	must	have	left	it	in	the	room	.
OK	,	I	'll	give	you	a	call	when	I	find	it	.
Why	?
Where	did	I	put	it	?
Oh	,	right	.
Handbag	.
It	's	in	the	handbag	.
Did	she	mention	ring	?
Yes	,	but	why	did	that	Ahjumma	from	the	class	reunion	wants	Mom	to	find	it	for	her	?
--------------------
Help	me	,	it	's	not	there	either	.
Hey	,	you	should	search	well	for	it	!
But	how	can	it	be	under	there	?
Did	you	really	bring	it	home	?
I	brought	it	back	for	sure	.
I	wouldn	't	drop	it	there	,	it	should	be	around	here	.
Oppa	,	stop	searching	.
What	about	here	?
Nothing	?
Hey	,	are	you	crazy	?
--------------------
Turn	and	turn	.
Don	't	,	don	't	do	it	.
Don	't	do	that	,	it	's	so	dirty	.
You	are	playing	dirty	today	.
No	!
Really	?
Aren	't	you	thinking	of	doing	it	?
NO	!
Don	't	do	it	right	now	.
OK	!
--------------------
Whatever	!
Hello	?
Why	do	you	sound	out	of	breath	?
For	some	reason	,	I	feel	good	when	you	call	me	"	Han	Yoo	Ju	"
Where	are	you	?
I	'm	in	Seoul	.
Let	's	meet	.
What	?
Are	you	kidding	?
Then	,	let	's	meet	in	front	of	Hongdae	later	.
--------------------
OK	.
It	's	great	here	,	right	?
Great	.
Over	here	,	they	have	spicy	rice	cakes	,	rice	sausages	and	Choi	Han	Kyul	as	well	.
And	Choi	Han	Seong	too	.
How	is	he	?
To	end	it	well	with	such	a	good	lover	.
DK	Ahjussi	.
DK	...
Welcome	.
--------------------
How	is	it	?
How	much	is	it	?
It	's	$10	.
Oh	,	that	hat	looks	great	on	you	.
Thank	you	.
So	unlucky	.
DK	Ahjussi	.
Isn	't	it	too	much	breaking	up	after	all	of	that	?
Why	are	you	totally	ignoring	my	feelings	right	now	?
You	can	start	anew	again	with	Han	Seong	.
--------------------
Meet	up	with	him	?
Still	,	you	were	his	first	love	.
You	're	being	a	bit	cruel	.
Let	's	go	.
Won	't	your	heart	be	moved	since	there	is	a	big	possibility	of	seeing	him	nearby	if	you	come	here	.
Does	it	make	you	more	comfortable	to	speak	like	this	?
Are	you	going	up	?
No	.
Wait	a	sec	.
I	'll	take	you	home	after	I	pick	up	the	presents	.
--------------------
Leave	,	rascal	.
Right	,	who	will	give	a	part-	timer	an	advance	pay	?
The	most	important	thing	in	delivering	meal	is	the	speed	.
OK	.
Fine	.
Wait	a	moment	.
Are	you	alright	?
Are	you	okay	?
What	happened	?
Handbag	.
--------------------
Let	me	take	a	look	.
Are	you	seriously	hurt	?
Are	you	okay	?
I	'm	fine	.
Don	't	just	keep	saying	that	you	are	alright	.
Stand	up	first	,	Noona	.
You	only	call	me	"	Noona	"	when	you	are	flustered	.
Get	up	,	rascal	.
Hey	,	you	are	..
You	,	snatch	thief	!
--------------------
How	dare	you	steal	!
I	want	to	pay	Eun	Sae	's	music	school	fees	,	so	what	?
Huh	?
Eun	Sae	's	school	fees	?
It	seems	like	someone	has	caught	the	thief	who	robbed	me	,	look	there	.
I	'll	go	over	there	while	you	stay	here	.
Let	's	go	together	.
Why	must	you	be	so	worry	over	Eun	Sae	when	she	's	my	lover	?
Eun	Sae	is	my	angel	.
A	person	like	you	must	be	put	in	jail	.
--------------------
Follow	me	.
It	's	really	crazy	.
Grab	the	chance	to	run	away	when	I	release	my	hands	,
What	?
Escape	,	you	sweet	carrot	.
Prepare	for	it	,	OK	?
A	young	boy	like	you	,	how	dare	you	think	about	robbing	people	!
On	the	count	of	three	.
1	..	2	..	3	..
What	?
--------------------
Push	me	away	and	run	.
Hey	,	stand	there	!
He	escaped	.
Thanks	.
Oh	,	you	got	hurt	.
Are	you	alright	?
Yes	,	I	'm	fine	.
I	'm	dead	!
What	are	you	doing	?
You	must	be	able	to	start	up	.
--------------------
What	are	we	to	do	?
It	's	all	because	of	me	.
Oh	no	.
It	's	because	this	is	already	a	piece	of	old	junk	!
You	can	send	it	for	servicing	first	and	then	,	give	a	call	here	.
You	guys	planned	the	act	beforehand	,	right	?
For	you	to	get	the	money	for	servicing	.
Isn	't	it	really	dangerous	for	the	criminal	to	be	staying	on	the	crime	scene	?
Tell	the	truth	,	isn	't	it	improving	?
Tin	bucket	,	antiquities	motorbikes	.
--------------------
What	exactly	are	you	talking	about	now	?	!
Han	Kyul	.
Just	give	me	a	call	if	you	decided	to	be	frank	about	it	.
I	'll	be	able	to	help	out	since	you	seem	to	have	a	pitiful	life	.
What	's	wrong	with	you	?	!
Aren	't	you	the	one	who	got	hurt	?
Leave	.
Why	are	you	like	this	?
Don	't	you	understand	those	kind	of	people	?
They	are	not	the	type	of	people	to	be	friendly	with	.
--------------------
Hey	there	!
Hey	!
I	'm	not	that	sort	of	person	!
I	'm	really	going	crazy	.
Why	won	't	you	start	?
What	?
Where	did	it	go	to	?
I	don	't	know	,	what	to	do	?
I	decided	to	employ	a	girl	because	it	's	cheaper	.
I	never	thought	you	will	be	getting	into	trouble	the	next	day	.
--------------------
Boss	,	why	do	you	need	to	bring	up	about	me	being	a	girl	?
If	you	are	not	a	girl	,	what	are	you	?
A	boy	?
No	.
The	scooter	parked	outside	,	you	have	to	pay	for	the	damage	.
With	that	,	you	and	me	,	we	are	finished	with	what	we	owe	each	other	.
Ssulja	,	Ssulja	!
(	*	the	dog	's	name	that	Eun	Chan	gave	;	means	"	sweeper	"	)
Hello	!
Have	you	been	well	?
--------------------
Let	us	practice	.
You	did	well	!
I	'm	feeling	a	little	better	all	because	of	you	.
I	'm	really	feeling	bad	lately	.
Thank	you	!
Hey	,	what	's	your	dad	doing	lately	?
He	should	come	out	and	take	a	walk	if	he	's	free	.
To	let	the	streets	become	brighter	as	well	,	got	it	?
Bye	,	unni	is	going	.
Bye	!
--------------------
Bye	!
Who	is	it	?
That	interesting	young	lady	.
Is	she	your	girlfriend	?
Mom	went	out	.
About	the	ring	?
Yes	,	I	heard	about	it	.
It	's	all	because	of	that	incident	.
Mom	and	unni	,	they	are	now	..
Mom	!
--------------------
Yes	,	Ahjumma	.
I	'll	ask	mom	to	give	you	a	call	when	she	comes	back	.
Yes	.
It	's	Dong	Sook	ahjumma	,	she	told	us	to	find	the	ring	back	before	next	week	.
It	belongs	to	her	elder	sister-	in-	law	.
She	has	gone	on	a	trip	but	will	be	returning	next	week	.
Are	you	able	to	get	a	little	of	the	ring	payment	?
How	am	I	going	to	get	it	?
I	even	lost	my	job	all	because	of	you	and	that	preserved	carrot	.
How	are	you	going	to	get	it	?
--------------------
Why	are	you	throwing	your	temper	on	me	?
Why	don	't	you	just	confront	that	fellow	since	you	are	so	mad	?
And	tell	him	to	repair	that	scooter	!
You	got	yourself	in	trouble	for	being	such	a	busybody	.
Somebody	just	know	how	to	say	it	out	without	even	practicing	what	she	preached	.
What	about	you	?
Your	studies	aren	't	good	and	you	can	't	speak	well	either	.
Hello	.
Yes	,	ahjussi	.
Yes	,	what	?
--------------------
How	can	you	suddenly	rise	the	rent	like	that	?
Who	is	it	?
I	understand	that	you	help	us	a	lot	during	this	period	.
Yes	.
Is	it	the	landlord	?
Yes	.
Yes	,	I	understand	.
Yes	.
What	?
Did	he	raise	the	rent	?
--------------------
Yes	,	$10,	000
This	is	really	.
Let	's	eat	.
How	can	I	eat	like	this	?
Mom	,	let	's	eat	.
I	'm	self-	reflecting	,	so	I	'll	be	peeling	more	chestnuts	from	today	onwards	.
Come	eat	!
Ahjussi	...
Ahjussi	,	what	are	you	doing	?
I	had	a	dream	.
--------------------
I	was	suffocating	while	being	squashed	by	my	sister-	in-	law	.
Ah	,	how	the	heavy	breath	was	simply	suffocating	me	.
The	piece	has	once	again	been	rejected	.
The	title	was	"	Raw	Meat	and	Living	"
Yes	,	but	...	ahjussi	.
The	butcher	who	must	slice	meat	into	pieces	.
Life	,	sadness	,	loneliness	,	setbacks	,	anger	,	knife	blades	,	love	and	fish	sauce	.
Ahjussi	,	I	need	some	money	.
Hey	,	why	can	't	you	understand	that	?
What	actually	is	the	use	of	all	these	?
--------------------
Can	only	a	hungry	muse	exist	for	a	poet	?
Goodbye	.
Our	rhythm	is	a	little	too	slow	.
Then	,	let	's	do	it	again	if	you	think	that	it	's	too	slow	.
Alright	.
Hyung	,	someone	is	looking	for	you	.
Have	you	been	well	?
It	's	really	hot	.
It	looks	like	a	thunderstorm	is	coming	,	see	how	dark	the	sky	is	.
It	should	be	the	typhoon	season	,	right	?
--------------------
I	've	been	here	for	a	month	.
I	'm	sorry	.
I	missed	you	.
Just	say	something	,	no	matter	what	it	may	be	.
Leave	.
It	was	really	sudden	when	you	left	.
It	's	still	really	sudden	when	you	return	.
And	also	,	I	don	't	drink	this	now	.
You	haven	't	found	work	yet	although	you	've	been	looking	for	it	since	morning	.
Have	you	eaten	?
--------------------
Do	you	want	to	a	slice	of	bread	?
Is	there	jam	?
Rascal	.
Ahjussi	.
Can	I	ask	for	loan	without	any	guarantee	?
Those	are	all	private	loans	.
The	kinds	that	let	you	write	the	agreement	to	give	up	your	body	.
If	not	,	can	I	draw	from	the	credit	card	?
No	,	if	you	are	known	as	a	bad	debtor	,	it	will	be	really	hard	for	you	to	maintain	your	social	life	.
Hey	,	are	you	really	that	short	of	money	?
--------------------
Didn	't	you	catch	a	robber	at	that	time	?
Didn	't	you	get	a	thank-	you	gift	?
Choi	Han	Kyul	.
No	,	how	can	I	just	ask	for	money	after	I	caught	a	robber	?
Didn	't	he	say	he	's	prepared	to	give	to	you	,	right	?
So	just	take	it	as	he	said	so	.
How	can	you	consider	so	much	since	you	are	in	such	a	situation	?
There	isn	't	much	here	.
This	should	add	a	little	to	this	month	's	rent	.
Don	't	open	it	now	.
--------------------
It	's	embarrassing	.
Ahjussi	.
You	know	I	like	you	,	right	?
Yes	,	Ah	Young	?
Wine	bar	?
Oh	,	that	's	great	.
I	don	't	care	if	it	's	a	part-	time	or	a	replacement	,	anything	is	fine	.
No	matter	what	,	Grandma	will	stand	on	my	side	.
But	it	seems	like	mom	can	't	stand	seeing	me	like	this	anymore	.
Hyung	,	why	don	't	you	inherit	the	company	?
--------------------
I	love	music	.
Your	movies	aren	't	doing	too	well	,	right	?
So	isn	't	it	good	for	you	to	inherit	the	company	?
I	'm	unable	to	do	anything	well	,	no	matter	what	I	do	.
I	'm	different	from	you	.
You	are	so	smart	.
I	met	Han	Yoo	Ju	.
What	's	this	?
How	am	I	supposed	to	wear	this	?
What	the	heck	is	this	?
--------------------
I	'm	going	crazy	!
Crazy	,	crazy	.
She	gave	up	studying	overseas	for	you	and	came	back	.
Don	't	mention	about	it	anymore	.
Then	what	shall	we	talk	about	?
You	still	like	her	?
Don	't	mind	me	.
Han	Yoo	Ju	already	said	that	I	'm	out	.
That	is	the	same	as	telling	me	that	it	should	end	.
Well	,	what	do	you	want	me	to	do	?
--------------------
Are	you	able	to	work	like	this	?
Then	,	can	't	you	just	let	me	work	in	the	kitchen	?
You	are	only	a	replacement	.
Stop	saying	nonsense	and	follow	me	quickly	.
He	's	totally	drunk	.
Go	out	and	call	the	taxi	,	okay	?
Yes	!
Get	up	,	ahjussi	.
Hey	,	what	's	the	address	?
The	Intern	hostel	,	107	building	503	.
--------------------
What	did	you	say	?
107	building	503	..
Go	quickly	.
504	?
Which	one	is	it	,	ahjussi	?
Ahjussi	,	wake	up	!
Where	do	you	live	?
Tell	me	the	address	quickly	.
What	?
So	there	's	still	a	woman	like	this	.
--------------------
Have	you	finished	drinking	?
I	still	have	an	appointment	.
Don	't	drive	after	you	drank	.
Don	't	worry	.
I	'll	find	a	replacement	driver	.
Be	careful	on	your	way	.
See	you	next	time	.
Bye	.
Hello	.
I	'm	in	Sam	Cheon	Dong	.
--------------------
Yes	,	the	security	area	.
How	much	time	do	you	need	?
A	few	more	minutes	,	okay	.
You	are	Ssulja	's	dad	.
You	are	Ssulja	's	dad	,	right	?
Ssulja	?
The	dog	that	went	a	round	the	district	during	his	exercise	,	your	dog	,	Ssulja	.
Oh	,	my	Terry	is	called	"	Ssulja	"	?
Oh	,	so	the	name	is	Terry	.
You	seem	to	be	living	in	our	district	.
--------------------
Yes	,	I	deliver	milk	to	your	house	.
You	don	't	know	it	,	right	?
Oh	,	the	young	lady	who	delivers	our	milk	.
My	Terry	's	girlfriend	?
Ah-	Woo	,	right	?
Then	,	is	it	a	boy	?
Yes	.
I	still	thought	that	it	has	a	really	big	chest	.
Oh	,	I	got	it	wrong	.
What	's	that	?
--------------------
Bubbles	,	I	found	it	there	.
Do	you	want	it	?
It	's	best	for	reducing	stress	.
Ahjussi	,	is	money	or	pride	more	important	to	you	?
What	?
Nothing	.
Hey	,	Replacement	!
Aren	't	you	coming	in	?
Ahjussi	,	I	'm	going	.
Hey	,	take	it	.
--------------------
Keep	it	,	I	'm	going	.
Bye	!
Rose	...
Ha	Rim	.
It	's	so	nice	to	see	you	!
Have	fun	!
Hey	,	what	have	you	been	eating	to	be	so	popular	?
Do	you	want	me	to	teach	you	?
Please	don	't	.
He	will	even	sell	off	his	properties	to	get	it	once	something	good	comes	along	.
--------------------
Oppa	!
Oppa	!
Oppa	,	Oppa	!
Excuse	me	.
Why	are	you	still	faking	it	with	a	body	like	this	?
Oppa	,	you	have	returned	for	good	this	time	?
I	planned	to	go	to	states	to	find	you	if	you	weren	't	coming	back	again	.
Why	are	you	here	when	we	made	contact	with	your	brother	?
It	's	so	like	there	to	force	herself	in	,	no	matter	what	the	situation	is	.
But	,	Oppa	.
--------------------
Are	you	really	going	for	the	match-	making	?
No	,	don	't	go	.
How	did	you	know	?
My	friend	gave	me	a	call	saying	that	she	will	be	attending	a	match-	making	with	you	.
She	's	really	nothing	at	all	.
She	did	her	chest	and	jaws	before	.
What	's	this	?
We	should	have	a	toast	since	we	haven	't	met	for	a	long	time	.
Oppa	,	let	's	do	a	lover	's	shot	.
What	lovers	?
--------------------
I	don	't	drink	wine	at	all	.
Just	do	it	for	her	,	Hyung	.
You	really	make	people	feel	so	tired	.
That	's	right	.
Just	one	glass	.
I	have	a	wish	since	high	school	to	have	a	lovers	'	shot	with	you	.
Just	satisfy	her	for	once	.
Her	annoying	voice	is	giving	me	goosebumps	!
It	's	crazy	,	really	.
Oh	,	no	.
--------------------
Something	bad	happened	.
Money	,	pride	.
Pride	,	money	.
Which	is	more	important	?
Let	me	guess	.
What	should	I	guess	?
I	'm	not	guessing	at	all	.
Hello	?
Yes	.
Dong	Sook	ahjumma	.
--------------------
Yes	,	hello	.
I	'm	so	sorry	.
Slowly	...
Take	care	,	Ye	Ran	.
Have	a	hot	night	with	hyung	.
Yes	,	thank	you	.
Bye	,	bye	.
So	cute	.
My	bank	account	balance	is	$420
Salary	from	the	Taekwondo	Hall	is	$800
--------------------
Three	months	...
Sticking	eyes	on	the	dolls	gives	$200
Delivering	milk	gives	$300
Yes	,	it	's	over	.
I	have	already	taken	it	.
My	$1,	000	before	and	savings	$5,	000	.
It	's	$6,	000	all	together	.
It	is	still	minus	$8,	000	!
Starting	from	today	,	Choi	Han	Kyul	is	mine	!
To	call	or	not	to	call	.
--------------------
To	call	.
Not	to	call	.
Hey	,	Go	Eun	Chan	.
Is	money	or	pride	more	important	?
Pride	.
Pride	.
Pride	.
Right	,	will	pride	be	able	to	feed	you	?
Only	money	can	feed	you	.
That	's	right	,	money	.
--------------------
Oh	,	cold	.
Who	is	it	?
Who	am	I	?
What	did	you	say	?
Oh	,	the	robber	.
I	'm	not	a	robber	.
I	was	the	one	who	caught	the	robber	.
Yes	,	the	scooter	.
I	want	a	little	thank	you	gift	.
What	?
--------------------
You	want	me	to	come	over	now	?
Where	is	"	over	there	"	?
Yes	,	yes	.
Oppa	...
Why	don	't	you	believe	what	I	say	?
Wear	it	and	leave	quickly	.
You	don	't	remember	anything	because	you	were	drunk	.
I	remembered	everything	.
You	were	carrying	me	,	and	then	you	put	me	here	.
You	undressed	my	upper	clothes	but	you	didn	't	dare	to	touch	the	lower	ones	.
--------------------
And	just	looked	on	quietly	.
Because	it	's	too	absurd	.
I	wanted	to	know	what	you	wanted	to	do	.
Leave	quickly	,	leave	.
Oppa	!
But	,	you	're	still	mine	!
That	's	right	,	I	should	get	the	money	that	I	should	receive	.
Yes	,	here	I	come	.
This	is	the	last	place	that	I	can	back	out	to	.
Although	it	's	going	to	be	hard	.
--------------------
Go	Eun	Chan	,	fighting	!
Oh	my	,	you	even	ordered	the	breakfast	.
Oppa	,	you	can	't	go	hungry	.
I	'm	not	eating	,	leave	quickly	.
I	'll	leave	after	I	wash	up	.
Who	is	it	?
You	really	came	?
Not	sure	if	he	's	here	for	the	money	or	some	ulterior	motive	...
You	are	under-	aged	,	right	?
No	.
--------------------
How	can	an	adult	go	out	in	public	like	that	?
And	also	,	are	you	a	boy	or	a	girl	?
You	look	exactly	like	a	girl	.
Have	you	been	to	the	army	yet	?
I	...
No	...
Sit	down	.
There	's	no	need	.
At	first	,	I	didn	't	want	to	ask	for	compensation	...
But	it	was	just	like	what	you	saw	,	the	scooter	's	start-	up	engine	is	completely	damaged	.
--------------------
To	make	it	more	clearly	...
I	was	fired	as	well	because	of	that	incident	.
I	didn	't	even	get	paid	before	they	kicked	me	out	.
And	so	,	you	want	some	money	for	compensation	?
Yes	.
How	old	is	that	fellow	who	ran	away	?
How	would	I	know	about	that	since	he	dropped	out	from	high	school	...
You	can	say	it	out	without	any	worry	since	I	don	't	intend	to	send	him	to	the	police	.
Although	I	may	guess	out	a	little	,	but	still	you	have	say	out	how	your	system	works	.
I	'm	really	interested	in	the	underground	society	.
--------------------
Underground	society	?
What	are	you	talking	about	?
I	think	you	better	get	this	clear	.
You	think	that	it	's	so	easy	to	get	by	in	this	world	?
That	's	right	,	you	really	looked	so	innocent	.
And	so	,	that	's	how	it	managed	to	work	.
This	is	your	first	time	,	right	?
It	must	be	really	embarrassing	.
Ahjussi	,	you	are	still	mistaken	right	now	.
I	have	no	relations	at	all	with	that	fellow	that	ran	away	.
--------------------
That	fellow	...
I	saw	it	all	.
I	saw	you	giving	him	the	whatever	finger	signs	,	don	't	you	know	?
Your	trick	had	fallen	through	,	don	't	you	know	?
You	brainless	fellow	.
I	think	it	's	more	pathetic	of	you	to	be	out	with	a	woman	at	night	.
Pathetic	?
Yeah	right	.
You	must	have	felt	envious	.
Oh	,	really	.
--------------------
You	look	down	on	me	just	because	I	'm	here	for	the	money	.
You	can	't	just	ignore	people	just	because	of	some	money	.
Rascal	,	why	are	you	shouting	here	?
Flat	down	!
Flat	down	?
Ahjussi	,	you	are	really	.
Oh	,	I	'm	going	crazy	.
What	are	you	doing	?
Flat	down	,	quickly	.
Let	go	of	me	.
--------------------
You	are	not	letting	go	of	me	?
Oppa	.
Oppa	,	are	you	gay	?
Oh	,	it	's	so	crazy	.
What	are	you	doing	?
Crazy	!
Crazy	!
Crazy	!
I	'm	going	crazy	!
Hey	,	aren	't	you	getting	up	?
--------------------
And	so	why	must	you	beat	up	others	?
Leave	.
Can	't	you	give	me	the	scooter	's	service	fees	?
I	didn	't	even	receive	my	part-	time	wages	.
Anyway	,	it	's	still	because	of	that	incident	.
Do	your	parents	know	this	as	well	?
That	you	are	begging	others	like	this	?
They	will	know	even	if	they	didn	't	see	.
There	will	be	such	a	son	since	there	is	such	a	father	.
Apologize	.
--------------------
How	can	you	be	saying	anything	about	my	parents	?
Apologize	to	me	!
I	told	you	to	apologize	!
Both	of	you	go	out	!
Apologize	!
Both	of	you	leave	!
Apologize	!
Both	of	you	leave	!
Leave	now	!
Apologize	!
--------------------
Leave	!
Apologize	!
Out	..
Apologize	!
Out	now	!
I	'm	not	going	out	.
Apologize	!
Oppa	!
Apologize	!
Apologize	!!
--------------------
Apologize	!!
Just	for	today	,	how	many	do	I	have	to	meet	?
Six	?
Why	must	the	match-	making	be	arranged	like	a	party	?
Don	't	be	like	that	,	Mom	.
Apologize	!
Apologize	to	me	,	apologize	!!
Money	seeker	.
Your	father	exported	300	this	year	,	right	?
Yes	.
--------------------
To	be	honest	,	my	wish	is	to	live	as	poorly	as	other	people	.
To	live	in	an	apartment	in	Kang	Nam	and	run	a	small	beauty	shop	.
Yes	.
I	feel	too	warm	.
Is	it	okay	to	take	my	jacket	off	?
Apologize	!
Apologize	!
Apologize	.
Excuse	me	,	a	glass	of	ice	water	.
Sir	.
--------------------
You	are	not	supposed	to	do	this	here	.
Oh	,	sorry	.
Sorry	.
You	should	apologize	when	you	did	something	that	needs	apologizing	.
Yes	,	I	'm	really	sorry	.
Sorry	.
Excuse	me	.
Sam	Bong	?
Oh	,	what	's	up	?
Oh	,	right	.
--------------------
It	's	spring	.
You	caught	it	,	I	got	it	.
Wait	till	I	come	back	.
What	?	!
I	majored	in	Korean	history	at	MlT	.
Oh	,	you	are	so	sexy	and	gorgeous	.
You	are	enjoying	with	me	?
I	'm	so	happy	.
Can	your	tongue	reach	your	chin	?
I	can	do	that	.
--------------------
Huge	cups	of	coffee	.
Seven	glasses	of	juice	.
It	's	flowing	so	smoothly	just	like	rain	.
Those	girls	are	all	so	troublesome	.
Really	...	why	are	all	the	girls	like	that	one	after	another	?
Apologize	.
Hey	,	what	are	you	doing	?
Apologize	.
Apologize	for	speaking	about	my	mom	and	dad	.
And	you	must	also	pay	up	for	all	the	expenses	I	used	to	follow	you	.
--------------------
The	scooter	's	servicing	fees	must	be	paid	up	as	well	.
You	really	have	lots	of	tricks	up	your	sleeves	.
You	and	all	the	women	that	came	out	for	the	match-	making	.
You	are	all	up	to	funny	tricks	.
Ahjussi	,	you	must	keep	up	with	your	status	as	well	.
All	the	women	that	came	for	the	match-	making	,	they	're	really	pretty	.
Is	it	that	you	like	men	?
Just	like	what	she	said	just	now	,	you	are	gay	.
Really	..	rascal	,	who	's	gay	...
Hey	,	can	you	turn	around	slowly	.
--------------------
Why	?
Hey	,	do	you	want	to	be	my	lover	?
If	you	're	giving	me	money	,	you	should	open	up	your	wallet	.
Why	did	you	open	your	notebook	?
Name	?
Go	Eun	Chan	.
ID	Number	.
8408052371	.
Hey	!
Say	it	correctly	!
--------------------
13	,	okay	,	13	!
Don	't	you	know	if	you	are	a	girl	or	guy	?
Why	must	you	write	up	such	a	thing	?
Giving	money	is	enough	.
I	'm	giving	you	a	chance	since	you	seem	to	be	needing	work	.
But	I	can	't	trust	you	.
What	kind	of	work	?
To	be	my	lover	.
You	bastard	!
I	heard	he	kissed	a	guy	and	beaten	up	by	a	woman	.
--------------------
Ahjussi	!
Ahjussi	!
What	good	things	have	you	been	doing	?
What	's	that	on	you	?
Mine	's	a	pig	.
A	big	fish	.
A	big	fish	.
I	broke	up	with	DK	.
I	want	to	start	again	with	you	.
I	wanted	to	forget	the	hurt	that	you	have	given	me	.
--------------------
Three	months	.
I	'll	give	you	money	.
You	have	to	restore	this	place	to	what	it	was	originally	.
It	's	the	place	that	you	will	be	working	.
This	is	your	teacher	,	President	Hong	.
Have	a	true-	hearted	talk	with	him	.

No	.
--------------------
Do	you	want	me	to	call	her	?
Yeah	,	that	'd	be	great	,	you	calling	a	12-	year-	old	girl	for	a	sleep	over	.
It	'll	be	fine	.
I	'll	make	you	a	deal	.
I	'll	call	a	friend	when	you	call	a	friend	.

Come	on	,	Samantha	,	you	're	gonna	be	late	for	school	.
What	are	you	talking	about	?
It	's	4	:	30	.
Are	you	okay	?
I	...
Tired	,	I	guess	.
I	don	't	know	.
House	M.	D.
--------------------
Season	5	Episode	6	"	Joy	"
Okay	,	bye	.
37-	year-	old	male	with	recurrent	blackouts	.
Tell	him	to	switch	from	tequila	to	bourbon	.
It	worked	for	me	.
The	three	doctors	he	's	already	seen	already	ruled	out	drugs	and	alcohol	.
Well	,	then	it	's	epilepsy	.
Tell	him	to	buy	a	hockey	helmet
ET	's	clean	so	is	the	CT	.
Relax	.
--------------------
Just	'cause	you	got	approved	by	an	adoption	agency	doesn	't	mean	you	'll	get	approved	by	the	birth	mother	.
You	're	a	single	mom	.
That	puts	you	somewhere	below	couples	that	quitted	in	daycare	scandals	.
You	're	welcome	,	Dr.	House	.
It	is	an	interesting	case	.
What	time	are	you	seeing	the	mom	?
You	're	having	your	guy	follow	me	?
I	just	trash	your	social	value	as	a	mother	and	all	I	got	was	a	little	sarcasm	.
It	means	you	don	't	feel	the	need	to	defend	yourself	,	which	means	you	're	not	worried	about	getting	a	kid	,	which	means	you	've	already	got	one	.
We	're	meeting	at	11	:	00	.
--------------------
She	's	due	to	deliver	a	baby	girl	in	two	weeks	.
I	'm	sure	the	mom	will	be	thrilled	to	hand	her	crack	baby	off	to	a	doctor	.
She	's	not	a	crack	baby	.
No	,	mother	's	perfectly	healthy	,	she	just	had	to	give	up	the	baby	in	order	to	continue	her	work	on	the	human	genome	.
She	confessed	to	some	past	meth	use	.
What	they	don	't	confess	to	is	almost	always	more	interesting	.
This	is	a	mistake	.
Because	a	kid	you	don	't	know	may	have	some	problem	that	you	don	't	know	about	that	she	may	have	passed	on	to	a	kid	?
Because	you	're	a	control-	seeking	narcicist	.
Which	is	fine	,	good	even	in	some	jobs	.
--------------------
But	you	're	not	equipped	to	handle	a	real	kid	nevermind	a	factory	second	.
Where	are	you	meeting	her	?
In	a	little	place	called	"	Follow	me	and	your	urologist	will	be	buying	himself	a	new	yacht	.	"
They	explained	the	returns	policy	,	right	?
It	's	worse	than	video	games	.
Not	changing	my	mind	.
Not	without	a	preconcussion	.
Pick	a	number	.
For	what	?
Cuddy	pool	.
--------------------
She	got	the	.
The	little	tweaker	is	doing	14	days	.
That	's	great	news	...
I	think	.
she	insisted	that	she	's	not	gonna	change	her	mind	,	which	means	she	's	actually	thought	about	changing	her	mind	which	means	she	's	not	ready	to	be	a	mom	,	which	means	she	's	gonna	change	her	mind	.
$100	buyin	'	.
Less	than	seven	means	the	next	seven	days	.
But	she	's	been	dying	for	a	kid	for	three	years	.
Not	one	of	the	options	.
Many	strokes	can	cause	blackouts	,	memory	loss	.
--------------------
Nine	hours	is	a	lot	of	time	to	be	out	from	a	mini-	stroke	.
And	there	'd	be	residual	damage	on	the	CT	.
He	could	've	been	exposed	to	a	toxin	that	caused	short-	term	memory	loss	,	which	wouldn	't	show	up	on	imaging	.
Cavernous	sinus	thrombosis	could	cause	absence	seizures	and	memory	loss	.
I	'll	take	7	to	14	.
We	have	a	player	.
You	just	said	it	was	great	news	.
Now	you	want	to	bet	against	her	?
It	's	only	great	news	if	she	wants	it	to	be	great	news	.
House	knows	her	better	than	any	of	us	.
--------------------
I	'd	rather	you	use	a	pseudonym	.
Good	thinking	.
I	say	she	's	gonna	meet	the	mom	and	bolt	.
Check	his	home	for	toxins	and	his	sinuses	for	thrombosises	.
Maybe	he	ODed	on	cafeine	.
Apparently	,	he	didn	't	drink	the	coffee	.
Just	smelled	it	.
Wow	!
Did	they	just	move	here	?
Six	years	ago	.
--------------------
This	is	no	way	to	raise	a	kid	.
He	's	a	single	dad	.
I	'm	sure	he	's	doing	his	best	.
Which	is	why	single	people	shouldn	't	have	kids	.
You	got	a	problem	with	what	Cuddy	's	doing	?
You	think	single	mothers	can	't
I	think	the	traditional	family	is	a	fraud	.
Even	married	moms	are	single	moms	.
Daddy	just	pays	some	bills	and	reads	just	enough	bedtime	stories	to	not	kill	himself	out	of	guilt	.
My	dad	was	great	.
--------------------
After	my	mum	died
He	might	be	the	exception	.
On	the	other	hand	,	you	are	fairly	screwed	up	.
No	booze	,	no	meds	,	no	drugs	.
And	no	view	.
The	building	's	half	empty	.
He	's	rather	have	a	view	at	the	turnpike	than	the	park	.
Park	views	are	probably	50	%	more	.
Are	you	surprised	the	guy	's	a	pragmatist	after	looking	at	this	place	?
Guy	's	not	a	pragmatist	.
--------------------
He	's	a	flagellant	.
Looks	like	mold	.
A	mom	would	've	cleaned	better	.
We	're	testing	both	of	you	.
I	feel	fine	.
I	'm	sure	you	are	...
We	're	just	being	cautious	.
Where	do	you	guys	go	other	than	home	and	school	?
Nowhere	.
Dad	works	at	home	and	I	go	to	school	.
--------------------
What	about	sports	,	friends	,	travel	?
Like	I	said	,	dad	works	at	home	and	I	go	to	school	.
Must	be	hard	not	having	your	mom	around	,	huh	?
I	was	only	4	when	the	accident	happened	.
Still	,	I	'm	sure	you	both	miss	her	sometimes	.
Not	really	...
You	're	strong	.
No	,	I	just	don	't	get	what	the	big	deal	about	death	is	,	you	know	?
Yeah	.
How	is	she	?
--------------------
Physically	,	she	's	fine	.
Mentally	,	she	's	weird	.
I	'm	sure	she	's	just	freaked	out	about	her	dad	.
Mr.	Harmon	?
Where	are	you	going	?
I	have	an	appointment	.
I	have	to	go	.
We	haven	't	finished	with	your	treatment	.
We	're	still	waiting	on	some	test	results	.
I	have	an	appointment	.
--------------------
Sorry	,	you	're	gonna	have	to	reschedule	.
I	really	have	to	go	.
Mr.	Harmon	,	do	you	know	where	you	are	?
Why	are	you	trying	to	stop	me	?
His	eyes	.
His	pupils	are	responsive	.
I	think	he	's	...	asleep	.
Unless	he	walks	out	a	window	.
Sleepwalking	's	not	a	diagnosis	.
It	's	a	symptom	.
--------------------
As	long	as	we	can	't	figure	out	why
Stress-	induced	insomnia	.
Lots	of	people	sleepwalk	.
Not	in	the	middle	of	the	day	before	they	've	even	put	their	head	on	a	pillow	.
Could	be	some	sort	of	narcolepsy	.
Which	is	caused	by
There	's	usually	genetic	history	.
if	you	know	the	answer	,	can	you	tell	us	the	answer	?
I	don	't	know	the	answer	.
Which	brings	us	back	to	--	or	?
--------------------
Some	sort	of	environmental	trigger	.
Which	means	?
It	's	a	toxin	.
So	we	are	?
Being	lead	down	an	annoying	path	.
I	honestly	don	't	know	where	this	is	going	.
Just	following	the	clues	.
And	there	's	nothing	else	at	his	home	.	and	?
And	you	're	obnoxious	.
Which	we	know	because	?
--------------------
Because	he	says	so	.
Because	his	daughter	says	so	.
Which	proves	he	never	goes	anywhere	else	...
Conscious	.
Oh	,	my	god	,	you	're	right	.
Send	him	home	.
See	where	his	dreams	take	him	.
Becca	?
Dr.	Cuddy	?
Lisa	.
--------------------
Nice	to	meet	you	.
Oh	,	you	want	one	?
I	can	't	stop	eating	them	.
I	guess	it	's	,	like	,	a	craving	.
I	must	have	,	like	,	a	dozen	a	day	.
Oh	,	and	this	is	decaf	.
oh	,	you	know	,	tired	,	fat	,	nervous	.
Is	there	,	um	,	anything	you	want	to	ask	me	?
Uh	,	yeah	,	actually	,	I	just	have	one	question	.
Um	,	what	are	you	gonna	call	her	?
--------------------
Ah	,	I	'm	not	sure	.
It	's	all	been	rather	sudden	,	you	know	?
I	like	joy	.
But	as	I	said	,	I	haven	't	really	decided	yet	.
Well	,	is	there	anything	you	want	to	ask	me	?
It	's	okay	.
The	agency	web	site	is	filled	with	prospective	parents	.
Their	photos	,	their	biographies	.
There	's	so	many	wonderful	people	out	there	.
Wonderful	couples	.
--------------------
Why	did	I	choose	a	single	mom	?
My	grandmother	was	married	for	37	years	to	a	man	that	treated	her	like	garbage	.
And	my	mom	would	've	stayed	married	to	my	loser	dad	that	long	,	but	he	dumped	her	.
You	know	,	I	never	understood	how	you	could	fall	for	the	same	crap	as	your	mother	.
Then	I	met	Tony	.
When	I	read	your	bio	,	a	doctor	,	a	head	of	a	hospital	,
I	saw	your	picture	...
I	don	't	want	her	raised	by	a	loser	.
How	long	have	you	had	that	rash	?
I	don	't	know	.
--------------------
A	few	days	?
Have	you	had	any	joint	pain	?
Yeah	,	I	'm	pregnant	.
All	my	joints	hurt	.
They	shouldn	't	all	hurt	.
Have	you	been	using	?
Not	in	seven	months	.
Not	since	I	found	out	I	was	pregnant	.
You	sure	you	don	't	want	children	?
You	know	,	just	because	we	're	stuck	here	and	I	'm	lying	down	doesn	't	mean	we	need	to	get	deep	.
--------------------
You	're	afraid	you	'll	make	the	same	mistake	you	made	with	your	wife	.
I	like	my	life	as	it	is	.
Alpha	waves	increasing	.
No	,	nothing	.
He	just	got	up	.
Maybe	it	's	a	result	of	the	blood	pressure	change	.
Delta	waves	out	of	nowhere	.
Brain	's	supposed	to	turn	off	motor	function	.
we	wouldn	't	be	here	.
What	's	that	?
--------------------
It	's	a	viral	infection	.
It	can	infect	the	fetus	.
Usually	in	the	first	20	weeks	of	pregnancy	,	and	in	women	who	have	trouble	with	their	immune	system	.
History	of	drug	abuse	could	've	compromised	her	immune	system	.
I	told	you	I	haven	't	used	anything	in	seven	months	.
It	does	look	more	like	a	heat	rash	to	me	.
Yes	,	well	,	maybe	we	want	to	look	at	the	actual	blood	tests	.
Of	course	.
She	work	for	you	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
Everybody	here	works	for	you	.
When	this	happens	for	real	,	are	you	okay	to	deliver	here	?
Yeah	,	sure	.
Good	.
Blood	work	's	normal	.
Test	it	again	.
Tested	it	twice	.
I	'll	get	you	some	topical	cream	for	that	rash	.
I	'm	admitting	her	.
There	's	nothing	wrong	with	her	.
--------------------
There	are	dozens	of	other	things	this	rash	could	indicate	.
I	want	a	full	fetal	work	up	.
You	're	losing	it	.
That	's	what	happens	when	you	have	kids	.
Ceaseless	crying	and	nagging
leads	to	irrational	fears	.
It	's	impressive	that	you	didn	't	wait	for	the	actual	crying	and	nagging	.
She	had	a	lace	pattern	rash	,	joint	pain	,	and	a	history	of	drug	abuse	.
You	would	've	done	exactly	the	same	thing	.
Uh-	huh	,	and	I	'd	be	an	excellent	father	.
--------------------
Oh	!
Hey	!
What	are	you	doing	?	!
Baby	barf	.
Maternity	ward	was	handing	out	free	samples	.
Well	played	,	sir	.
You	leave	me	no	choice	but	to	change	.
My	clothes	,	not	my	mind	.
That	's	exactly	my	point	.
It	's	not	gonna	be	me	and	a	cup	.
--------------------
It	's	gonna	be	eight	times	a	day	.
If	you	can	't	handle	wearing	that	stain	,	you	can	't	handle	a	baby	.
Why	do	you	even	care	?
It	's	not	like	I	'm	ever	gonna	ask	you	to	babysit	.
I	'm	a	humanitarian	.
We	should	stop	him	.
let	him	plow	into	some	innocent	bystander	?
His	legs	are	working	.
Obviously	,	his	eyes	are	working	too	.
Maybe	.
--------------------
Pull	up	to	her	.
I	know	.
What	'd	that	guy	want	?
Piss	off	.
Go	after	him	.
She	's	not	a	hooker	.
How	do	you	know	?
apparently	,	rip	's	a	coke	fiend	.
So	sleeping	beauty	has	a	jones	for	snow	white	.
Narcolepsy	explains	the	sleepwalking	.
--------------------
But	it	doesn	't	explain	the	rip	in	the	space	time	continuum	.
which	leads	to	sleepwalking	.
What	caused	the	first	sleepwalking	?
The	coke	he	took	while	he	was	wide	awake	.
Says	he	didn	't	.
Wouldn	't	be	the	first	time	somebody	lied	about	drug	use	.
He	knows	he	's	sick	.
His	job	doesn	't	drug	test	.
Maybe	he	just	forgot	.
Forgot	he	did	cocaine	?
--------------------
fits	.
Cocaine	explains	the	narcolepsy	.
Whatever	is	in	the	cocaine	other	than	the	cocaine
Dealers	cut	this	stuff	with	all	kinds	of	garbage	.
Great	,	we	'll	start	him	on	immediate	treatment
You	can	narrow	it	down	in	the	lab	.
Not	without	a	sample	.
So	get	a	sample	.
You	want	us	to	score	cocaine	from	a	drug	dealer	?
It	's	exciting	.
--------------------
It	's	a	felony	.
It	's	necessary	.
Amniotic	fluid	looks	good	.
Good	fetal	movement	.
Heart	's	beating	nicely	.	heh	.
What	?
It	looks	like	pulmonary	hypoplasia	.
What	's	that	?
The	baby	's	lungs	are	underdeveloped	.
She	won	't	be	able	to	breath	on	her	own	.
--------------------
She	might	die	?
I	don	't	know	.
If	she	was	born	today	,	she	'd	be	in	trouble	,	but	we	're	not	gonna	let	that	happen	.
We	'll	put	you	on	magnesium	to	prevent	labor	and	steroids	to	grow	the	lungs	.
It	's	a	good	thing	dr	.
Cuddy	brought	you	in	.
How	do	you	know	what	a	drug	dealer	looks	like	?
I	'm	not	doing	drugs	,	if	that	's	what	you	're	asking	.
I	just	noticed	that	she	had	cash	in	her	hand	.
Obviously	came	from	him	.
--------------------
Obviously	didn	't	have	enough	time
I	didn	't	notice	her	holding
There	she	is	.
Cops	aren	't	allowed	to	say	that	,	right	?
Yeah	,	they	can	say	it	.
Oh	.
But	if	you	were	a	cop	,	you	'd	know	that	.
What	do	you	want	?
Um	--	ahem	.
I	would	like	to	buy	some	cocaine	,	please	.
--------------------
Oh	,	definitely	not	a	cop	.
Thank	you	.
Wait	.
It	's	good	.
Glad	you	like	it	,	pablo	.
Now	can	we	go	?
No	.
You	gave	us	the	wrong	stuff	.
What	are	you	talking	about	?
You	got	my	best	.
--------------------
I	know	.
I	don	't	want	the	good
"	get	your	new	customer	hooked	"	stuff	.
I	want	the	stepped	on
"	keep	the	old	customer	coming	back	for	more	"	stuff	.
Are	you	crazy	,	bitch	?
No	,	I	'm	a	just	a	bitch	who	knows	what	she	wants	.
Looks	like	this	kid	thing	is	really	working	out	for	you	.
All	of	the	shopping	,	none	of	the	stretch	marks	.
Not	a	good	time	.
--------------------
Right	,	kid	's	getting	worse	.
Blessing	in	disguise	.
Although	a	completely	predictable	one	.
don	't	be	surprised	by	the	worms	.
Still	wearing	the	sweater	.
I	said	you	weren	't	maternal	.
Thank	you	.
Go	away	.
You	're	getting	crankier	.
Baby	's	sick	.
--------------------
Sorry	I	'm	not	finding	the	fun	in	that	.
Is	it	really	worth	it	?
Just	for	the	pursuit	of	unconditional	love	?
Only	you	could	see	that	as	a	bad	thing	.
It	's	a	fake	thing	.
There	's	no	unconditional	love	.
It	's	just	unconditional	need	.
a	victim	of	your	biological	clock	.
Victim	?
You	think	she	's	better	off	staying	--	yes	!
--------------------
Because	at	least	she	knows
I	'm	gonna	tell	her	not	to	play	ball	in	the	house	,	but	she	's	not	gonna	listen	.
No	,	actually	,	I	was	going	for	she	sneaks	her	boyfriend	in	while	you	're	sleeping	,
And	at	first	she	says	no	,	but	she	has	issues	with	self-	esteem	.
You	know	you	're	gonna	pay	for	that	.
I	'm	paying	for	it	right	now	.
With	wisdom	.
Get	out	.
We	found	lactose	.
The	coke	was	cut	with	milk	powder	.
--------------------
Makes	it	nutritious	.
Not	much	of	a	toxin	.
It	is	if	he	's	allergic	to	milk	.
He	's	not	.
He	has	milk	in	his	fridge	.
How	does	he	like	his	coffee	?
I	don	't	know	.
What	does	that
What	type	of	cereal	's	in	the	cabinet	?
Cocoa-	something	.
--------------------
Why	,	what	does	it	matter	?
He	likes	his	coffee	black	.
Milk	's	for	the	kid	.
How	can	you	be	sure	?
Because	if	he	drank	the	milk	,	he	'd	know	that	he	's	lactose	intolerant	.
Ask	him	,	then	treat	him	for	allergic	reaction	.
If	he	gets	better	,	we	all	get	to	go	home	early	.
Steroids	make	you	more	prone	to	infection	.
You	'll	have	to	stay	here	for	the	new	two	weeks	so	we	can	monitor	you	.
The	baby	's	lungs	,	is	that	because	of	...	the	meth	?
--------------------
Could	be	.
You	must	hate	me	.
If	you	'd	done	everything	right	in	your	life	,
I	wouldn	't	be	getting	a	baby	.
You	're	not	scared	?
I	am	scared	.
You	got	,	like	,	this	perfect	life	.
Not	yet	.
What	's	that	?
Heart	rate	's	climbing	.
--------------------
What	's	wrong	with	her	?
It	's	not	the	baby	.
It	's	you	.
I	need	two	units	of	o-	negative	,	stat	!
She	's	losing	blood	.
So	deliver	the	baby	.
The	lungs	are	ten	weeks	premature	.
So	deliver	now	,	risk	the	baby	.
Deliver	later	,	risk	the	mom	.
It	's	not	your	baby	yet	.
--------------------
It	's	not	your	call	.
She	'll	do	whatever	I	tell	her	to	do	.
Self-	worth	issues	.
That	's	genetic	,	you	know	.
You	should	deliver	now	.
Right	.
Are	you	serious	?
You	're	not	?
You	just	told	me	--	-	The	wrong	answer	.
You	can	't	give	the	fetus	more	lungs	.
--------------------
The	lungs	might	work	.
It	's	the	right	decision	medically	.
And	yet	you	're	here	.
To	get	your	opinion	,	not	to	get	jerked	around	.
See	,	this	is	what	's	screwed	up	here	.
You	're	not	sure	that	this	is	the	right	call	,	but	you	are	sure	that	this	is	what	you	want	to	tell	her	.
because	your	motives	aren	't	medical	.
Some	part	of	you	doesn	't	want	this	baby	,	and	that	part	wants	to	tell	her	to	kill	it	.
This	is	an	impossible	situation	.
I	'm	advising	her	to	take	the	safest	route	.
--------------------
Right	.
Doesn	't	explain	why	you	changed	your	sweater	.
I	need	your	advice	.
It	's	not	cancer	.	wow	!
Can	you	remove	spleens	with	your	mind	too	?
You	're	here	to	talk	about	Cuddy	.
The	file	is	a	pretext	.
Why	the	hell	haven	't	you	come	to	talk	to	me	about	Cuddy	?
I	've	been	doing	all	sorts	of	insane	stuff	.
If	she	can	't	handle	your	insanity	,	she	can	't	handle	a	baby	.
--------------------
That	's	exactly	my	point	.
No	,	it	isn	't	.
You	're	feeling	threatened	because	she	's	going	on	to	high	school	and	leaving	you	behind	to	repeat	the	eighth	grade	.
She	's	sleeping	with	the	math	teacher	to	get	a	diploma	.
Adoption	is	cheating	?
Are	they	giving	her	a	fake	kid	?
That	's	the	problem	.
She	gets	to	have	a	relationship	with	a	kid	,	but	she	can	't	handle	one	with	an	adult	.
So	she	's	gonna	kill	it	.
Well	,	it	does	seem	cleaner	.
--------------------
I	've	seen	the	file	.
She	's	making	a	judgment	call	.
Decisions	are	never	made	in	a	vacuum	.
Just	like	your	decision	to	make	her	miserable	.
You	're	doing	this	because	we	no	longer	have	inkwells	and	Cuddy	doesn	't	have	pigtails	.
Why	do	you	think	I	did	that	?
How	you	doing	?
Not	sure	.
Been	keeping	an	eye	on	the	clock	like	you	said	.
I	don	't	think	I	lost	any	time	.
--------------------
The	machinery	agrees	with	you	.
That	means	your	problems	were	caused	by	the	coke	.
Can	't	believe	I	did	coke	.
You	were	asleep	.
I	chose	to	do	coke	.
In	your	sleep	.
You	weren	't	responsible	.
Something	inside	me	wanted	to	do	it	.
Something	inside	of	me	didn	't	think	it	was	wrong	.
It	's	like	a	dream	.
--------------------
We	all	do	stuff	in	our	dreams	we	wouldn	't	do	when	we	're	awake	.
I	don	't	.
What	's	that	?
Did	I	fall	asleep	and	hurt	myself	?
I	don	't	see	any	cuts	.
Because	there	aren	't	any	.
I	think	...
You	're	sweating	blood	.
Guy	's	bleeding	out	of	his	pores	.
What	does	that	tell	us	?
--------------------
Other	than	you	don	't	want	to	play	basketball	against	him	and	he	's	dying	?
È«	ÉíÐÔµÄ	»	á²	»»	áÊÇ³öÑª²¡	¶¾ÄØ	?
It	's	not	an	infection	.
D.	i	.	c	.	?
Coags	are	normal	.
It	's	cancer	.
Leukemia	explains	everything	.
Leukemia	'd	be	obvious	from	the	cbc	.
Leukemia	has	false	negatives	all	the	time	.
So	we	have	four	reasons	for	leukemia	,	four	reasons	against	.
--------------------
Only	need	one	against	.
Yeah	,	if	we	had	one	reason	for	anything	else	.
Go	do	a	bone	marrow	biopsy	.
What	would	you	do	?
I	think	...
I	think	you	should	wait	.
But	if	I	wait	...
I	could	die	.
There	would	be	more	danger	for	you	,	but
Is	this	your	opinion	as	a	doctor	or	as	a	mother	?
--------------------
It	's	my	medical	opinion	.
It	's	my	personal	opinion
I	don	't	want	to	wait	.
It	might	only	be	one	week	.
We	will	keep	you	on	plasma	.
This	is	not	my	baby	.
nine	months	for	this	stupid	mistake	.
I	don	't	--	I	don	't	want	to	sacrifice	any	more	.
Becca	,	you	asked	my	opinion	because	you	wanted	to	do	the	right	thing	.
You	are	giving	up	this	baby
--------------------
You	have	a	chance	to	break	this	cycle	,	to	do	something	great	for	this	baby	.
No	.
I	need	you	to	hold	still	.	unh	.
Wait	.
Have	you	been	testing	any	tanning	creams	or	sprays	?
No	.
It	's	not	a	tan	.
Means	it	's	not	leukemia	.
Unh	.
Chem	panel	confirms	kidney	failure	,	end	stage	.
--------------------
Got	him	on	dialysis	?
BP	's	too	low	.
Too	bad	.
It	would	've	been	nice	to	have	more	than	an	hour	or	two	to	solve	this	thing	.
Hemachromatosis	?
He	have	tiny	testes	?
No	.
Scleroderma	.
His	skin	's	darker	,	not	lighter	.
As	much	fun	as	20	questions	tends	to	be	,	he	's	blowing	blood	out	of	every	orifice	,	you	think	it	just	might	be	vascular	?
--------------------
Vasculitis	?
If	I	had	said	it	might	be	"	vitas	gerular	,	"	would	you	have	said	"	vitas	gerulaitis	?	"	test	him	for	vasculitis	,	angio	and	blood	.
Even	if	we	're	right	,	he	's	gonna	need	a	kidney	transplant	.
Test	the	daughter	.
She	's	12	.
Small	kidney	.
It	just	means	he	won	't	pee	as	much	.
Great	for	road	trips	.
I	meant	she	's	a	minor	and	daddy	has	a	conflict	,	so	we	're	gonna	need	Cuddy	's	signoff	.
So	get	it	.
--------------------
She	's	...	kind	of	busy	.
Clamp	.
Suction	.
Entering	the	abdominal	cavity	.
There	's	the	head	.
get	out	of	here	.
He	's	the	one	you	'll	be	suing	when	you	develop	sepsis	.
Well	,	why	is	he	here	?
Better	question	is	why	is	she	here	?
I	have	a	patient	's	daughter	needs	a	guardian	ad	litem	.
--------------------
House	,	get	out	!
This	doesn	't	need	you	.
I	do	.
Head	's	out	.
Later	.
Later	's	too	late	.
And	there	she	is	.
Come	on	.
Come	on	.
Joy	,	cry	.
--------------------
I	'm	sorry	.
I	'm	so	sorry	.
Apgar	's	nine	out	of	ten	.
You	hear	that	?
You	just	got	your	first	"	a	.	"
She	's	...	yours	now	.
Mazel	tov	.
Mommy	's	gotta	go	to	work	.
Have	the	risks	of	the	transplant	procedure	been	explained	to	you	?
Damn	it	.
--------------------
I	was	hoping	you	weren	't	going	to	ask	her	that	.
Of	course	she	knows	.
Dr.	House	explained	to	you	that	all	surgeries	carry	risk	?
You	could	die	.
And	if	you	don	't	do	it	,	daddy	will	die	.
Sorry	.
Daddy	's	perfectly	healthy	.
because	it	'd	be	cool	if	he	had	three	.
Shut	up	.
Do	you	understand	the	risks	of	living	with	one	kidney	?
--------------------
Yeah	.
And	you	still	want	to	proceed	with	the	transplant	?
Yeah	.
Okay	,	go	ahead	.
No	.
I	'm	saying	you	can	proceed	.
I	'm	saying	I	can	't	.
Whatever	he	has	,	she	has	too	.
She	's	sleepwalking	.
When	your	remote	has	a	dead	battery	,	you	don	't	replace	it	with	another	dead	battery	.
--------------------
Whatever	's	killing	the	dad	's	kidneys	is	gonna	kill	the	kid	's	too	.
It	is	possible	the	sleep	issues	aren	't	medically	related	.
Maybe	they	both	drink	too	much	coffee	,	maybe
House	is	right	.
How	do	you	know	?
Because	the	daughter	's	sweating	blood	.
it	means	there	has	to	be	a	common	cause	.
Which	means	it	has	to	be	a	toxin	,	infection	,	or	genetic	.
And	since	we	've	ruled	out	infections	and	toxins
It	narrows	it	down	to	any	one	of	a	dozen	genic	disorders	,
--------------------
Call	Foreman	.
Get	to	work	.
I	need	a	genetic	disease	.
I	'm	sure	you	're	carrying	a	few	.
Symptoms	are	kidney	failure	,	bleeding	,	and	insomnia	.
You	paid	off	the	pool	?
Technically	,	anyone	who	didn	't	enter	is	a	winner	.
It	's	not	over	yet	.
Everyone	's	happy	until	they	unwrap	that	pretty	present	and	find	they	got	a	wall	clock	in	the	shape	of	Africa	.
Adoption	's	a	cheat	,	remember	?
--------------------
Cuddy	will	be	the	happiest	new	mother	you	've	ever	seen	.
I	've	just	given	you	the	answer	,	haven	't	I	?
And	now	you	're	going	to	walk	out	of	here	without	saying	a	word	.
Nope	!
I	know	what	you	have	,	and	you	're	both	gonna	be	fine	.
What	?
Are	you	serious	?
Yes	and	no	.
So	you	do	know	what	they	have	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
no	idea	.
They	might	be	.
Why	the	hell	would	you	say	they	were	?
To	make	them	happy	.
We	should	've	seen	a	grin	,	a	twinkle	,
They	're	sick	.
They	're	tired	.
They	're	anhedonic	,
They	're	depressed	.
You	should	know	that	being	bummed
--------------------
Being	bummed	doesn	't	explain	their	lack	of	friends
Why	their	place	had	no	music	,	no	view	,	no	decor	.
But	if	you	can	't	feel	pleasure	,	what	's	with	the	cocaine	?
Really	?
Is	that	why	you	do	drugs	?
Because	you	're	happy	?
His	subconscious	craved	it	,	needed	it	.
Most	common	cause	of	anhedonia	is	schizophrenia	.
Sure	,	in	white	folk	.
They	're	black	?
--------------------
They	're	liars	.
What	's	your	name	?
Jerry	Harmon	.
Your	real	name	.
Hosarian	?
H	'Ali-	Baba	?
Hammoud	.
Jamal	Hammoud	.
How	'd	you	know	?
You	and	your	daughter	have	familial	Mediterranean	fever	.
--------------------
It	's	a	genetic	disease	contracted	by	people	of	Mediterranean	descent	.
Sephardic	Jews	,	Armenians	,	Arabs	.
Causes	anhedonia	,	seizures	,	kidney	failure	,	even	lactose	intolerance	.
but	she	could	get	stressed	by	daddy	dying	.
You	don	't	know	if	we	'll	get	better	?
Treatment	tends	to	be	hit	and	miss	once	you	reach	the	sweating	blood	stage	.
His	kidneys	are	fried	.
If	he	doesn	't	have	fmf	,	the	colchicine	will	kill	him	.
Boy	,	sure	hope	I	'm	right	.
Mr.	Harmon	?
--------------------
Mr.	Harmon	,	I	need	you	to	open	your	eyes	.
Feeling	better	?
How	's	Samantha	?
Healthy	enough	to	toss	you	a	kidney	.
Dad	?
Sammy	.
Labor	&	delivery
the	baby	's	doing	great	.
I	...
I	can	't	imagine	how	hard	this	must	be	for	you	.
--------------------
I	was	--	I	was	stupid	and	selfish	.
You	were	scared	.
Yeah	,	but	you	wouldn	't	have	been	.
That	's	not	true	.
Well	,	I	mean	,	you	would	've	been	scared	,	but	...	you	would	've	done	the	right	thing	anyway	.
And	I	want	to	be	like	that	.
I	don	't	--	I	don	't	want	to	be	a	loser	.
You	're	not	a	loser	.
When	I	saw	you	hold	her	it	was	the	most	beautiful	thing	I	've	ever	seen	.
And	that	's	when	I	realized	...
--------------------
I	can	't	.
Becca	.
My	life	,	it	's	always	been	about	pain	,	and	anger	,	and	disappointment	,	never	about	love	.
And	I	can	't	give	that	away	.
Becca	,	don	't	do	this	.
Uh	...
What	you	're	feeling	is	natural	.
with	hormones	,	and	emotion	,	and	fear	,	and	...
You	just	can	't	make	a	huge	decision	like	this	right	now	.
You	have	to	give	it	some	time	.
--------------------
I	am	...	I	'm	so	sorry	.
It	's	a	decision	that	changes	everything	.
Changes	the	rest	of	your	life	.
I	hope	so	.
*	Don	't	take	away	my	shine	*
*	My	shine	is	all	I	have	*
*	My	heat	,	my	love	,	my	beauty	,	and	my	glad	*
*	It	worries	me	sometimes	*
*	That	I	want	love	*
*	And	live	a	life	of	sad	*
--------------------
*	My	tremolo	*
*	Sweet	baby	*
*	My	fire	*
It	's	really	not	the	greatest	time	for	gloating	.
There	's	more	than	one	baby	in	the	sea	.
The	world	is	full	of	teenage	boys	riding	bareback	.
No	.
I	'm	done	.
I	can	't	go	through	that	again	.
You	're	quitting	.
--------------------
Just	like	you	quit	IVF	.
Yeah	,	just	like	that	.
There	,	you	just	did	it	again	.
It	's	too	bad	.
You	would	've	made	a	great	mother	.
You	son	of	a	bitch	.
you	told	me	I	'd	suck	as	a	mother	.
Now	that	I	've	lost	it	,	you	tell	me	I	'd	be	great	as	a	mother	.
Why	do	you	need	to	negate	everything	?
I	don	't	know	.
--------------------
Good	night	.
Good	night	.
Previously	on	Desperate	Housewives
Can	we	start	over	?
It	was	a	surprising	day	for	the	women	of	wisteria	lane	.
Well	,	I	was	wondering
If	you	might	want	to	have	dinner	with	me	.
Okay	.
He	's	giving	her	orgasms	?	!
Ah	!
--------------------
Not	deliberately	.
I	can	see	we	're	going	to	be	great	friends	.
You	are	a	vibrant	,	attractive	woman	,	you
Who	hasn	't	had	sex	in	two	years	.
That	spells	"	grandma	"	to	me	.
Let	me	come	stay	with	you	when	I	get	outta	here	.
This	guy	thinks	I	'm	out	of	commission	,
And	I	want	to	keep	it	that	way	.
What	's	wrong	with	you	?
You	've	been	antsy	all	night	.
--------------------
I	think	I	left	the	freezer	door	at	scavo	's	open
But	it	was	an	even	more	surprising	night	...
Crap	!
It	's	my	dad	!
For	the	scavos	.
Where	is	she	?
Don	't	.
She	isn	't	wearing	anything	,	all	right	?
Who	is	she	?
Just	some	girl	from	english	class	.
--------------------
I	'm	gonna	go	in	the	bathroom	.
You	got	60	seconds	to	get	her	out	of	here	.
That	same	night
Five	minutes	later
There	was	a	slight	misunderstanding
In	the	scavo	house	that	night	.
You	see	,	someone	in	the	family
Was	having	an	affair	with	a	married	wom	,
And	lynette	scavo	suspected	her	husband	.
False	alarm	.
--------------------
The	freezer	was	shut	tight	.
Unfortunately	for	lynette	,	she	was	wrong	.
Liar	.
What	?
I	always	knew	things	could	change	between	us	,	tom	,
But	no	matter	what	,
The	one	thing	I	always	thought	I	'd	get	is	your	respect	.
Lynette	,	what	's	going	on	?
I	followed	you	to	the	warehouse	.
I	know	everything	.
--------------------
Oh	,	boy	.
Yeah	,	at	this	point	,
I	think	I	'm	gonna	need	a	little	bit	more	than	that	.
You	're	right	.
I	shouldn	't	have	kept	this	from	you	.
And	...
You	know	,	for	what	it	's	worth	,	I	wanted	to	bring	you	in	on	it	.
Huh	?
But	I	was	afraid	you	'd	overreact	.
That	's	what	you	were	afraid	of	?
--------------------
Hey	,	I	'm	upset	,	too	.
But	let	's	face	it	.
Boys	will	be	boys	.
I	think	...
I	have	to	sit	down	now	.
Lynette	,	are	you	really	surprised	?
It	's	not	the	first	time	this	has	happened	.
And	it	definitely	won	't	be	the	last	.
You	know	what	?
I	have	to	kill	you	now	.
--------------------
Well	,	he	's	your	son	,	too	.
Who	?
Porter	!
What	are	you	talking	about	?
I	found	out
Porter	's	been	hooking	up	with	some	girl	at	our	warehouse	.
What	are	you	talking	about	?
And	just	like	that	,
The	slight	misunderstanding	in	the	scavo	house	had	ended	...
Hey	.
--------------------
What	's	up	?
You	're	having	sex	with	your	best	friend	's	mother	?	!
And	a	huge	family	crisis
Had	begun	.
Desire	...	It	's	an	emotion	designed	to	lead	us	astray	,
Causing	us	to	buy	things	we	can	't	afford	...
Encouraging	us	to	sample	desserts
We	don	't	need	...
And	pushing	us	into	love	affairs
We	're	clearly	not	ready	for	.
--------------------
I	want	you	to	call	that	woman
And	tell	her	you	are	never	seeing	her	again	.
Her	name	is	anne	.
Her	name	is	mrs	.
Schilling	.
She	was	your	t-	ball	coach	when	you	were	6	.
By	the	way	,	does	your	best	friend	know
You	're	sleeping	with	his	mother	?
We	're	keeping	our	relationship	from	kirby	for	now	.
This	isn	't	a	relationship	.
--------------------
You	are	being	used	by	this	woman	.
No	,	I	'm	not	.
I	love	her	.
Okay	,	that	's	it	.
I	'm	calling	her	.
No	.
Hey	!
What	if	her	husband	answers	?
Gee	,	porter	.
That	's	just	one	of	the	pitfalls	of	dating	a	married	woman	.
--------------------
Listen	to	me	!
Mr.
Schilling	can	't	find	out	.
He	--	he	's	totally	violent	.
He	--	he	would	kill	her	.
Well	,	then	you	have	put	her	in	a	very	dangerous	position	,
Haven	't	you	?
Okay	.
I	'll	call	her	.
I	'll	tell	her	it	's	over	.
--------------------
I	'm	not	going	to	say	that	you	know	.
That	'll	just	freak	her	out	.
But	you	have	to	promise	me
That	you	won	't	say	anything	to	her	psycho	husband	.
I	am	not	promising	anything	.
So	help	me	,	if	I	find	out
That	you	do	something	,	and	she	gets	hurt	,
I	will	leave	this	house	and	I	will	never
Come	back	!
Oh	,	please	!
--------------------
You	would	never	do	that
Yeah	?
Well	,	i-	i	've	done	a	lot	of	things
You	never	thought	I	would	do	.
Wait	.
We	won	't	say	anything	.
But	if	you	don	't	end	this	,	you	won	't	have	to	leave	.
We	will	throw	you	out	.
So	...
You	wanted	to	see	me	?
--------------------
Sit	.
Tell	us	,	charlie	...
Have	you	enjoyed	working	here	at	mrs	.
Van	de	kamp	's	?
Yeah	.
It	's	great	.
You	don	't	feel	you	've	been	underpaid	?
No	.
Well	,	then	perhaps	you	can	explain
Why	you	stole	$200	from	the	petty	cash	box	yesterday	.
--------------------
What	?
I	didn	't	steal	anything	.
Charlie	,	we	wouldn	't	accuse	you	unless	we	had	concrete	evidence	,
And	thanks	to	my	diligent	partner	here	,	we	do	.
So	am	i	,	like	...
Fired	?
You	're	more	than	"	like	"	fired	.
You	're	fired	.
And	,	of	course	,	we	want	our	money	back	.
Uh	,	I	don	't	have	have	it	.
--------------------
I	spent	it	.
Well	,	then	I	suggest	you	return	your	purchase	.
Do	you	have	a	receipt	?
Yeah	.
Yeah	,	like	pot	dealers	give	receipts	.
Well	,	you	've	just	covered	yourself	in	glory	on	this	one	.
Just	...
Please	,	don	't	tell	my	parents	.
I	'll	get	you	the	money	.
I	promise	.
--------------------
Can	you	believe	it	?
A	thief	and	a	pothead	!
Well	,	at	least	we	know	now
Where	the	2	pounds	of	cookie	dough	went	.
Too	many	?
Yeah	.
I	gotta	have	one	more	.
Ah	!
Thank	you	for	doing	this	.
Ah	,	well	...
--------------------
We	needed	to	wipe	the	slate	clean	,	right	?
Mm	.
And	honestly	?
This	is	the	best	second	first	date	I	've	ever	had	.
Isn	't	it	?
And	knowing	we	're	not	gonna	have	sex
Takes	all	the	pressure	off	.
That	's	...
Something	we	know	?
Yes	.
--------------------
We	're	starting	completely	over	,
So	this	time	,	we	're	gonna	do	things	right	.
W-	which	means	what	?
Well	,	it	means	...
No	sex	until	at	least	date	four	.
Ah	.
I	want	us	to	spend	this	time
Really	getting	to	know	each	other	.
I-	i	do	know	you	.
What	's	my	least	favorite	word	?	"	phlegm	.	"
--------------------
You	're	just	guessing	.
It	's	"	panties	.	"
Ohh	.
Although	some	days	it	's	"	larva	"	or	"	chunks	.	"
Well	,	I	will	try	to	remember	that	.
Mm	.
Now	you	tell	me	something	I	don	't	know	about	you	.
Okay	.
I	'm	a	painter	.
I	sort	of	guessed	that	when	you	painted	my	house	.
--------------------
I	mean	,	I	paint	...
Art	.
Like	...
On	a	canvas	,	in	a	frame	.
Seriously	?
I	went	to	art	school	in	paris	.
And	my	professor	had	a	beret	,	so	you	know	he	was	good	.
So	now	you	're	painting	...
My	bathroom	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
It	sucks	.
But	I	've	been	blocked	for	the	past	year	.
Blocked	?
Yeah	.
I	mean	,	I	keep	trying	to	start	new	pieces	,	but	...
Nothing	comes	.
It	's	...
Driving	me	crazy	.
Well	,	I	'm	sorry	things	aren	't	going	well	.
But	I	'm	glad	you	told	me	.
--------------------
See	?
We	're	getting	to	know	each	other	.
And	we	wouldn	't	have	if	we	'd	spent	the	whole	night	in	bed	.
And	now	I	'm	creatively	and	sexually	frustrated	.
First	dates	are	awesome	.
Jeez	,	roberta	,	I	know	you	hate	to	throw	anything	away	,
But	do	you	have	the	garbagemen	bringing	you	stuff	now	?
Pardon	my	french	,	but	what	's	french	for	"	kiss	my	ass	"	?
So	you	said	dave	has	a	secret	.
Now	how	you	gettin	'	that	from	this	?
--------------------
It	's	just	a	bunch	of	phone	numbers	.
Yeah	,
It	may	be	just	a	bunch	of	numbers	to	you
But	to	a	savvy	sleuth	with	a	keen	eye
And	the	nose	of	a	bloodhound	--	yeah	,
Yeah	,	you	're	miss	marple	with	a	bum	liver
So	what	's	he	hiding	?
Let	me	walk	you	through	it	.
Around	the	1st	of	every	month	,
Dave	gets	a	string	of	calls	--	five	or	six
--------------------
From	this	number	in	boston	.
They	're	all	short	--	10	,	15	seconds	.
My	guess	is	he	's	not	picking	up	.
Somebody	's	leaving	him	messages	.
You	know	,	buggin	'	him	.
Once	a	month	,	huh	?
My	guess	is	it	's	an	ex-	wife	looking	for	her	alimony	.
Except	it	's	not	.
You	see	this	?
After	a	few	days	,	he	always	calls	back	.
--------------------
And	who	,	you	ask	,	is	he	calling	?
A	hospital	in	boston	.
It	's	the	office	of	dr	.
Samuel	heller	...
Psychiatrist	.
So	...
Once	a	month	,
Dave	whines	about	his	life
To	a	beantown	headshrinker	,	huh	?
Big	whoop	.
--------------------
I	looked	up	your	davey	's	doc	on	the	web	.
He	's	not	your	garden-	variety	shrink	.
He	's	a	renowned	psychiatrist	and	published	author
With	a	very	specialized	field	of	expertise	.
And	that	,	my	dear	watson	,
Is	your	neighbor	's	little	secret	.
Treating	the	criminally	insane
Oh	,	lap	of	luxury	,
Hoi	've	missed	sitting	in	you	.
Celia	!
--------------------
Juanita	!
Chef	is	taking	fresh-	baked	cookies	out	of	the	oven	.
You	're	not	gonna	catch	me	!
Oh	,	I	can	't	tell	you	how	nice	it	is
To	hear	the	sound	of	children	's	laughter	in	this	house	.
You	know	what	I	was	thinking	?
Why	don	't	you	all	stay	the	weekend	?
Ooh	,	we	'd	love	to	.
Jeez	,	we	can	't	.
Why	not	?
--------------------
Celia	's	birthday	party	is	sunday	.
We	've	gotta	get	ready	for	it	,	remember	?
What	's	to	get	ready	?
You	buy	a	$9	sheet	cake
And	fling	a	piata	over	a	tree	and	bam	!
Party	time	.
But	I	don	't	have	a	change	of	clothes	.
My	nephew	left	a	whole	closet	full	of	old	clothes	.
I	'm	sure	something	will	fit	you	.
Well	...
--------------------
Carlos	,	just	nod	your	head	,
'	cause	I	ain	't	leaving	this	pool	.
Oh	,	good	.
It	's	settled	.
Oh	,	gaby	.
Your	margarita	's	getting	low	.
I	'll	send	brandon	out	with	a	fresh	one	.
Thank	you	.
What	are	you	doing	?
What	?
--------------------
You	heard	the	woman	.
She	wants	children	's	laughter	.
And	I	want	the	lobster	the	chef	is	serving	for	dinner	.
It	's	a	win-	win	.
I	just	don	't	feel	comfortable	with	this	.
Why	not	?
I	mean	,	look	at	this	place	.
It	's	like	shangri-	la	.
Wow	,	you	're	right	.
The	pitch	black	I	see	here
--------------------
Is	much	more	dazzling	than	the	one	at	home	.
What	is	your	problem	?
My	problem	is	that	it	's	a	bad	idea
To	mix	business	and	pleasure	.
Says	the	man	who	massaged	her	into	an	orgasm	.
Even	more	reason	to	keep	some	professional	distance	.
Carlos	,	she	is	just	a	lonely	old	woman
Yearning	for	some	friendship	and	human	contact	.
And	i	,	for	one	,	am	happy	to	be	that	human	.
Mrs.	Solis	?
--------------------
Your	margarita	.
Oh	,	shoot	.
I	can	't	reach	it	.
Hey	,	guys	.
Sorry	I	'm	late	.
Hey	.
You	bring	beer	?
Was	I	supposed	to	?
No	.
Tom	was	supposed	to	.
--------------------
Gosh	.
Sorry	.
I	thought	the	two	cases	I	bought	monday
Would	've	lasted	more	than	one	rehearsal	.
Boys	,	we	're	better	off	not	drinking	today	.
We	've	got	a	lot	of	work	to	do	and	only	one	week	to	do	it	.
What	are	you	talking	about	?
We	are	playing
Battle	of	the	bands	at	the	white	horse	!
Uh	,	dave	?
--------------------
Battle	of	the	bands	isn	't	for	amateurs	.
You	gotta	audition	.
Uh	,	we	don	't	.
Edie	's	got	a	real	estate	buddy	whose	husband	owns	the	club	.
You	're	kidding	.
We	're	playing	an	actual	gig	?
In	front	of	people	who	aren	't	listening
Just	because	I	pay	their	allowance	?
Well	,	this	is	fantastic	!
Yes	!
--------------------
But	that	means	the	pressure	's	on	.
We	gotta	really	rehearse	our	cover	stuff
And	...
We	need	an	original	song	.
I	don	't	know	anything	about	songwriting	.
I-	i	know	a	little	bit	.
No	,	you	don	't	.
It	's	fine	.
Mike	and	I	will	write	something	.
You	got	a	little	time	later	?
--------------------
Not	tonight	.
I	got	plans	.
"	plans
What	's	her	name	?
Can	we	just	rehearse	,	please	?
You	know	,	I	heard	that	susan	and	jackson
Broke	up	.
I	heard	they	got	back	together
It	's	not	susan	.
Stop	guessing	.
--------------------
Also	,	get	lives	.
Whatever	,	mike	,
Just	so	long	as	you	're	having	fun	.
Hey	!
Who	said	you	--	turn	the	board	around	.
Get	back	here	.
No	!
Come	out	here	and	show	me	some	moves	!
Sorry	to	bother	you	.
Just	wanted	to	see	if	you	needed	anything	before	I	go	off	to	bed	.
--------------------
No	,	we	're	good	.
Sure	you	don	't	want	to	order	margarita	number	12	?
You	sure	you	don	't	want	to	shut	your	piehole	?
It	's	so	cute	,	how	you	two	bicker	.
Carlos	,	how	do	those	pajamas	fit	you	?
They	're	perfect	.
I-	i	hope	your	nephew	doesn	't	mind	that	I	was	wearing	'em	.
He	'll	never	know	.
We	're	estranged	.
Oh	.
--------------------
Okay	.
Anyway	,	we	're	good	.
So	have	a	nice	night	.
Oh	!
What	's	that	?
Some	animated	thing	.
I	love	animated	movies	.
The	girls	wanted	to	watch	it	,
So	we	're	kind	of	having	a	family	movie	night	.
Ooh	,	that	sounds	like	fun	!
--------------------
My	heavens	,	is	that	penguin	surfing	?
Gee	,	I	don	't	know	.
I	can	't	really	see	the	screen	anymore	.
Oh	,	dear	.
I	'm	being	rude	.
Oh	,	that	's	okay	.
There	.
That	's	better	.
Did	she	just	crawl	under	...
Oh	,	yeah	.
--------------------
And	so	there	I	was	in	ninth	grade	,
And	my	boobs	had	not	made	an	appearance	.
I	was	desperate	.
Here	.
Let	me	refill	that	for	you	.
And	so	that	's	when	I	got	caught	stuffing
At	the	pep	rally	.
And	six	months	later	...
Kaboom	.
I	was	voted	prom	queen	.
--------------------
Nice	work	,	girls	.
Stop	that	right	now	.
What	?
The	sex	music	.
Turn	it	off	.
That	--	that	's	not	sex	music	.
We	are	not	having	sex	until	date	number	four	,
And	this	is	date	number	two	.
I	know	what	it	is	.
It	--	it	's	just	that	you	look	so	hot	in	these	pants	,
--------------------
And	your	hair	smells	so	good	.
And	your	eyes	...
Look	,	I	made	you	dinner	.
Come	on	.
Jackson	--	I	braised	beef	for	you	.
Do	you	know	what	a	pain	in	the	ass	it	is	to	braise	meat	?
Okay	,	do	you	know	how	sad	it	makes	me
To	know	that	you	only	braised	it	to	boink	me	?
You	're	supposed	to	be	asking	me	questions	.
The	point	of	all	this	was	to	get	to	know	each	other	better	.
--------------------
How	is	it	gonna	make	our	relationship	stronger
For	me	to	know	that	in	the	fifth	grade	,
They	sent	you	to	the	therapist
'	cause	you	wouldn	't	stop	chewing	your	hair	?
You	know	,	that	was	hard	for	me	to	share	,
And	the	fact	that	you	just	make	light	of	it	...
No	,	I	'm	am	calling	the	second	date	officially	over	.
And	you	know	what	?
I	was	going	to	let	you	feel	me	up	over	my	blouse	.
But	now	?
--------------------
Nada	.
So	before	we	wrap	up	here	,
We	still	need	some	chaperones	for	the	junior	prom	.
Anne	schilling	is	coordinating	the	volunteers	,
And	she	could	really	use	some	help	.
Nobody	?
I	know	we	're	all	busy	,
But	this	is	important	.
We	want	our	kids	to	have	fun	,	but	let	's	face	it	.
If	we	don	't	keep	an	eye	on	them	,
--------------------
God	only	knows	what	kind	of	trouble	they	'll	get	into	.
Helen	?
Marjorie	?
You	'll	help	?
Fantastic	.
Thanks	,	guys	.
Hey	,	lynette	.
Do	these	meetings	keep	getting	longer	,
Or	do	they	just	seem	that	way	?
I	don	't	know	.
--------------------
So	...
How	's	the	family	?
I	haven	't	seen	penny	in	so	long	,
And	all	the	kids	are	getting	so	big	now	.
I	guess	the	boys	will	be	going	off	to	clege	soon	.
Aah	!
Lynette	!
I	know	everything	,	okay	?
Ok	...
I	'm	sorry	,	but	...
--------------------
It	's	important	for	you	to	understand	...
I	love	porter	.
So	do	i	.
And	if	you	ever	lay	a	hand	on	him	again	,
You	will	find	out	just	how	much	.
Oh	,	bree	.
I	've	got	good	news	.
Me	,	too	.
You	go	first	.
I	hired	a	girl	to	replace	that	thief	charlie	.
--------------------
Oh	.
Well	,	are	you	sure	she	's	trustworthy	?
Well	,	she	comes	with	a	strong	recommendation
From	the	head	of	the	local	f	.	B.	I.	Office
Her	father	,	who	's	mormon	.
Well	done	,	orson	!
Thank	you	.
Your	turn	.
"	the	new	christian	reader	"	just	published
An	advance	review	of	my	cookbook	.
--------------------
Listen	!	"	mrs	.
Van	de	kamp	's	colorful	stories	of	her	upbringing
"	show	her	upstanding	values	,
But	her	recipes	are	sinfully	delicious	.	"
They	gave	me	four	halos	!
Then	I	think	this	is	appropriate
Holy	cow	!
I	have	to	admit	,
I	had	some	reservations	about	us	working	together	,
But	this	has	succeeded	beyond	my	wildest	dreams	.
--------------------
Mmm	.
We	're	quite	a	team	,	aren	't	we	?
Yeah	,	and	the	best	part	is
We	get	to	see	each	other	all	the	time	.
Mm-	hmm	,	I	know	,	which	makes	the	hardest	part
Keeping	my	hands	off	you	all	the	time	.
Orson	!
You	can	't	be	serious	!
Here	?
This	kitchen	is	the	birthplace	of	our	triumphs	.
--------------------
What	better	place	to	celebrate	them	,	hmm	?
Ooh	!
Oh	,	this	counter	's	hard	on	my	head	.
Do	you	want	me	to	stop	?
No	.
Get	me	an	oven	mitt	.
Right	.
Oh	,	much	better	.
Rise	and	shine	,	girls	.
Rise	and	shi
--------------------
Oh	,	my	god	!
What	are	you	doing	?	!
Gaby	,	it	's	fine	.
We	're	just	doing	a	little	art	project	.
I	told	the	the	girls
They	could	decorate	the	room	any	way	they	wanted	.
I	'm	making	a	castle	.
It	's	stupid	.
No	,	you	're	stupid	!
You	're	both	stupid	.
--------------------
Stop	it	!
Um	,	mrs	.
Hildebrand	,	this	is	really	nice	of	you	.
But	why	would	you	want	to	ruin	your	beautiful	room	?
Oh	,	it	's	not	my	room	anymore	.
It	's	their	room	.
What	?
Yes	.
It	's	the	room	they	'll	be	staying	in
Whenever	you	come	to	visit	.
--------------------
They	're	getting	a	new	tv	,	bunk	beds	.
I	'll	have	it	ready	by	the	time	you	get	here	next	weekend	.
Uh	...
Next	weekend	,	uh	,
Carlos	and	I	have	plans	.
Well	,	I	bet	the	girls	don	't	.
I	'll	send	a	car	for	them	.
I	...
Don	't	think
That	's	such	a	good	idea	.
--------------------
How	about	it	,	girls	?
Wanna	spend	next	weekend	here	?
Yay	!
Yay	!
Thank	you	.
Mrs.	Hildebrand	.
Oh	!
Oh	!
What	did	I	tell	you	?
Sorry	.
--------------------
Thank	you	,	grandma	.
Oh	,	come	!
"	grandma	"	?
She	told	them	to	call	her	"	grandma	"	?
Yeah	,	and	that	's	why	we	're	leaving	.
After	you	told	her	you	'd	stay	all	weekend	?
How	we	gonna	do	that	?
I	don	't	know	.
Make	an	excuse	.
Say	you	ha	some	blind	thing	you	have	to	go	to	.
--------------------
We	have	to	be	very	careful	here	.
This	woman	has	a	lot	of	pull	at	the	country	club	.
Plus	,	we	've	got	that	europe	trip	coming	up	.
Whoa	,	whoa	,	whoa	.
We	're	not	going	to	europe	with	grandma
Nutjob	.
I	'm	not	walking	away	from	$100,	000
We	need	that	money	.
Carlos	,	it	's	not	worth	it	.
She	's	really	starting	to	freak	me	out	.
--------------------
Damn	it	,	gaby	.
I	told	you	it	was	dangerous	getting	chummy	with	the	clients	.
You	wouldn	't	listen	.
You	had	to	stay	for	the	lobster	.
Hey	,	I	seem	to	remember	some	melted	butter	on	your	bib	,	too	.
Now	how	we	getting	out	of	here	?
Look	,	she	knows	we	've	got	celia	's	party	tomorrow	.
I	'll	tell	her	we	have	to	go	shopping	for	that	.
Everything	will	be	fine	.
Sorry	.
--------------------
I	had	to	wait	for	my	folks	to	go	to	the	store
Before	I	could	sneak	out	.
What	's	wrong	?
Are	you	okay	?
I	don	't	know	what	to	do	.
About	what	?
Let	me	help	you	.
It	's	just	all	such	a	mess	.
Wait	.
Is	this	about	my	mom	?
--------------------
Did	she	do	something	else	to	you	?
Did	she	call	your	husband	?
No	.
Well	,	then	what	?
Tell	me	.
I	'm	pregnant	.
Hey,	o	you	mind	if	I	cut	out	early	today	?
I	don	't	see	why	not	.
I	mean	,	everything	's	,	uh	,	pretty	much	done	here	.
You	can	go	now	if	you	like	.
--------------------
Thanks	.
Andrew	.
Don	't	you	look	handsome	?
Do	i	?
Great	.
Something	wrong	?
You	remember	charlie	,	the	kid	you	guys	fired	for	stealing	?
Well	,	he	called	and	asked	how	you	could	prove	it	,
And	I	said	,	"	we	've	got	a	surveillance	tape	,	scuzzball	.	"
Well	,	uh	,	guess	who	stole
--------------------
The	surveillance	tape	last	night	.
That	does	it	.
We	're	pressing	charges	.
Uh	,	you	--	you	might	want	to	hold	off	on	that	,
Because	according	to	charlie	,
The	surveillance	tape	is	also	a	sex	tape	.
What	?
Yeah	,	he	said	it	shows	a	couple	really	going	at	it	.
So	...
Any	idea	who	those	crazy	kids	might	be	?
--------------------
Oh	,	dear	god	.
Yep	.
Kinda	thought	so	.
How	could	this	be	happening	?
Before	anything	got	serious	,
I	made	a	point	of	turning	the	camera	off	.
Wait	,	I	turned	it	off	,	too	.
I	didn	't	see	you	do	that	.
No	,	you	were	looking	for	the	olive	oil	.
Obviously	,	you	turned	it	back	on	.
--------------------
We	need	to	,	um	,	get	that	tape	back	.
Yeah	,	well	,	break	out	your	checkbook	,
'	cause	he	wants	2	grand	for	it	.	$2,	000	?	!
Yeah	,	or	he	's	gonna	post	it	on	youtube	.
What	are	we	gonna	do	?
Well	,	first	you	need	to	decide
What	your	porn	names	are	gonna	be	.
Okay	,	this	is	not	a	joke	.
My	book	comes	out	next	month
My	old-	fashioned	,	traditional	cookbook	!
--------------------
This	could	ruin	me	!
All	right	,	bree	.
We	'll	just	pay	him	.
No	!
I-	i	refuse	to	pay	blackmail	to	some	hooligan
Who	's	stolen	from	us	twice	!
Andrew	...
All	my	life	,	I	have	done	my	best	to	teach	you
To	respect	god	and	the	law
And	never	to	harm	another	living	thing	.
--------------------
I	want	you	to	forget	every	one	of	those	lessons
If	it	'll	help	you	get	that	tape	back	.
So	...
Carte	blanche	?
Uh	...
Within	reason	.
We	are	not	condoning	arson	or	violence	or
Orson	,	don	't	cramp	the	boy	's	style	.
Hey	,	sweetie	.
Now	don	't	forget	to	make	a	wish	.
--------------------
Happy	birthday	!
Happy	birthday	.
Virginia	!
What	,	uh	,	are	you	doing	here	?
I	came	to	give	celia	her	birthday	gift	.
Well	,	she	's	a	little	busy	with	her	friends	right	now	,
So	just	give	it	to	me	,	and	I	'll	make	sure	she	gets	it	.
I	'm	afraid	that	won	't	be	possible	.
You	see	,	for	my	present	,	I	'm	gonna	take	her	to	a	shop
That	sells	the	most	exquisite	antique	dolls
--------------------
And	let	her	pick	whichever	one	she	likes	.
Well	,	she	's	not	gonna	leave	her	party	to	go	buy	a	doll	.
Well	,	of	course	not	.
I	'll	wait	on	the	porch	till	it	's	over	.
Uh	,	look	,	I	'm	sorry	,
But	I	don	't	want	you	driving	off	with	my	daughter	.
Well	,	you	know	she	'll	be	safe	with	me	.
But	if	you	'd	feel	better	joining	us	...
You	sure	are	making	this	hard	.
I	have	tried	to	be	nice	,	but	I	am	running	out	of	polite	here	,
--------------------
So	I	'm	just	gonna	say	knock	it	off	.
I	'm	sorry	.
Knock	off	what	?
This	whole	creepy	,	clingy	"	i	'm	your	grandma	"	routine	.
But	I	've	come	to	feel	like	a	grandmother	to	the	girls	.
In	three	days	.
That	's	the	creepy	part	.
What	a	hurtful	thing	to	say	,
Especially	given	how	generous	I	've	been	to	your	family	.
Yeah	,	too	generous	.
--------------------
It	's	like	you	're	trying	to	buy	us	or	something	.
Well	,	we	're	not	for	sale	,	so	just	back	off	!
Who	do	you	think	you	're	talking	to	?
You	wicked	,	ungrateful	girl	!
You	're	not	the	first	greedy	bitch
Who	's	tried	to	bleed	me	dry	and	then	wash	her	hands	of	me	.
Okay	,	we	're	done	here	.
Good-	bye	.
Am	I	not	making	myself	clear	?
Get	off	my	property	!
--------------------
Gaby	.
What	's	going	on	?
I	came	to	buy	celia	a	doll	.
I	believe	you	've	heard	gaby	's	response	.
Virginia	,	please	.
Allow	me	to	apologize	.
I	think	it	's	a	little	late	for	that	.
Thank	you	...
For	a	wonderful	third	date	.
And	I	'm	glad	that	you	're	back	on	board	with	our	plan	.
--------------------
Yeah	,	I	really	think
I	'm	starting	to	get	something	out	of	it	.
Mmm	.
Oh	,	pop	quiz	!
Why	did	kim	beale	stop	talking	to	me	in	eighth	grade	?
Well	,	you	told	erin	connors	about	her	nose	job	.
Right	!
What	time	is	it	?
Uh	,	10	:	48	?
No	.
--------------------
It	's	sex	time	!
Hey	.
Wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	susan	.
What	?	!
Stop	.
We	're	not	having	sex	till	the	fourth	date	,	remember	?
Jackson	,	look	at	me	.
I	'm	tipsy	.
I	'm	horny	.
I	'm	easier	than	a	5-	year-	old	's	homework	.
--------------------
I	'll	call	you	tomorrow	.
The	forehead	?
I	hate	to	say	anything	,	stan	,
But	you	are	president	of	the	country	club	.
You	need	to	know
That	the	way	carlos	touched	me	during	my	last	massage	...
Well	,	let	's	just	say	it	was	highly	inappropriate	.
And	that	kind	of	behavior
Is	a	liability	the	club	can	't	afford	.
Good	.
--------------------
I	appreciate	your	taking	care	of	it	.
Hello	?
Uh	,	hello	.
Is	this	dr	.
Heller	?
Speaking	.
Who	's	calling	?
I	'm	maggie	carr	at	hilltop	insurance	.
We	have	an	applicant
For	a	new	term	life	insurance	policy	,
--------------------
And	he	lists	you	as	a	previous	care	provider	.
I	was	hoping	to	verify	his	medical	history	.
The	name	's	dave	williams	.
Dave	williams	?
I	don	't	know	a	dave	williams	.
Well	,	sure	you	do	.
You	call	him	every	month	.
How	would	maggie	know	that	?	!
Uh	,	I	'm	guessing	.
Who	is	this	?
--------------------
Uh	,	hi	,	dr	.
Heller	.
I	'm	,	uh	,	lindsay	thorne	.
I	'm	maggie	's	supervisor	.
And	she	's	confused	and	about	to	get	fired	.
And	,	uh	,	we	just	need	you	to	confirm	for	our	records
That	you	're	treating	a	man	named	david	williams	.
What	is	your	medicare	i	.	D.	Number	?
Um	...
I	'm	not	sure	.
--------------------
We	're	in	the	process	of	converting	to	the	metric	system	.
I	don	't	know	who	this	is	,
But	are	you	aware	that	what	you	are	doing	is	illegal	?
Okay	,	look	.
We	're	just	trying	to	get	some	info	on	this	guy	.
He	just	moved	to	fairview	,
And	he	's	really	creeping	people	out	.
You	're	in	fairview	?
Yeah	.
Why	?
--------------------
Does	that	mean	something	to	ya	?
No	,	I	'm	just	trying	to	get	all	the	info	I	need
When	I	contact	the	federal	authorities
To	let	them	know	that
Well	,	we	really	screwed	the	pooch	on	that	one	.
Yeah	,	back	to	the	drawing	board	.
Can	I	irish	that	up	for	ya	?
It	's	noon	somewhere	.
You	got	the	tape	!
How	did	you	manage	that	?
--------------------
Orson	,	we	don	't	need	to	know	.
No	,	you	don	't	,	but	it	's	kind	of	amazing
What	you	can	get	a	bunch	of	bikers	to	do	for	a	case	of	beer	.
Oh	,	my	.
Well	,	I	better	destroy	this	.
Actually	,	you	may	want	to	watch	it	first	.
Why	?
I	'm	embarrassed	enough	as	it	is	.
Humor	me	.
I	'll	cue	it	up	.
--------------------
You	watched	it	?	!
Well	,	I	had	to	make	sure	it	was	the	right	disk	.
Here	,	just	watch	a	little	bit	.
Oh	,	dear	god	.
I	can	't	look	.
Really	,	andrew	.
Wait	.
Bree	,	that	's	not	us	.
What	?
Well	,	who	is	it	then	?
--------------------
Wait	,	wait	.
He	flips	her	in	just	a	sec	.
This	is	where	it	gets	good	.
Katherine	!
And	mike	.
Just	so	you	know	,	I	'm	--	i	'm	never	eating	anything
That	comesut	of	that	kitchen	again	.
Jackson	?
I	am	declari	this
Our	official	fourth	date	,	okay	?
--------------------
The	rules	have	been	followed	,
And	you	may	begin	disrobing	...
Now	.
Uh	,	I	'm	--	i	'm	--	i	'm	--	i	'm	kind	of	doing	something	right	now	.
Okay	,	I	just	ran	into	your	house	half-	naked	.
The	only	thing	you	should	be	doing	is	me	.
What	is	on	your	face	?
Is	that	paint	?
Are	you	painting	again	?
Uh	,	y-	yeah	.
--------------------
I	thought	you	were	blocked	.
I	was	,	but	,	uh	...
Not	having	sex	for	a	few	days
Kinda	got	my	juices	flowing	in	a	different	direction	.
So	now	i-	i	really	need	to	finish	,	so
So	you	've	broken	through	your	creative	logjam	?
Congratulations	!
Ooh	,	why	not	celebrate
By	ripping	off	my	clothes	with	your	teeth	?
I	...
--------------------
Can	't	.
I	'm	not	finished	yet	.
How	close	are	you	?	'cause	I	can	wait	.
Wait	,	wait	,	no	.
No	,	don	't	--	don	't	look	at	that	...
Yet	.
That	's	me	.
Yeah	.
Uh	,	it	's	...
Supposed	to	be	.
--------------------
That	look	on	my	face	...
I	've	seen	before	...
In	the	mirror	,	when	I	'm	feeling	...
How	do	you	know	about	that	look	?
I-	i	know	a	lot	about	you	.
I	know	your	cheeks	get	red	when	people	say	you	're	pretty	.
I	know	that	your	eyes	start	to	tear	up
Whenever	you	talk	about	your	grandfather	.
And	I	know	that	when	you	're	really	sad	,
You	get	that	beautiful	,	haunted	look
--------------------
That	you	try	to	shake	off	before	anybody	can	see	it	.
I	can	't	believe	I	ever	thought	you	didn	't	know	me	.
Well	,	I	guess	I	should	let	you	finish	this	.
I	'm	sort	of	missing	hands	.
Actually	,	that	is	one	detail	I	could	use	some	help	with	.
Really	?
Unless	you	have	a	problem	posing	naked	.
Oh	.
Come	on	.
I	think	you	know	the	answer	to	that	.
--------------------
Hello	,	katherine	.
Um	,	I	thought	you	might	want	this	videota	...
From	our	surveillance	camera	.
We	have	a	surveillance	camera	?
Yes	,	in	the	,	uh	,	test	kitchen	.
Oh	,	my	god	.
So	that	means	you	saw	me	and	...
Mike	.
Yes	,	indeedy	.
Oh	,	I	'm	so	embarrassed	!
--------------------
Oh	,	what	you	must	think	of	me	!
Let	's	not	dwell	on	it	.
Oh	!
I	mean	,	having	sex	in	the	kitchen	,
Where	food	's	prepared	...
What	kind	of	a	demented	slut	would	do	that	?
I	said	...
Let	's	not	dwell	on	it	.
Thanks	for	bringing	it	by	.
Katherine	,	I	'm	sorry	,	but	I	just	have	to	ask
--------------------
Are	you	sure	you	know	what	you	're	doing	?
Meaning	what	?
Meaning	susan	is	your	oldest	friend	on	this	street	.
She	divorced	him	,	bree	,	and	she	's	seeing	someone	else	.
Why	can	't	mike	do	that	?
Because	she	's	your	friend	,	and	we	're	women	.
We	don	't	do	that	to	each	other	.
Look	...
I	've	been	alone	for	five	years	.
I	'm	finally	in	a	relationship	,
--------------------
And	you	're	trying	to	make	me	feel	guilty	?
Is	that	what	I	saw	on	the	tape	--	a	relationship	?
I	don	't	know	what	it	is	.
All	I	know	is	...
I	'm	having	the	time	of	my	life	.
Fair	enough	.
But	just	be	careful	,
I	mean	,	this	is	very	complicated	.
I	'd	hate	to	see	it	end	badly	.
Hey	,	breakfast	's	on	the	table	.
--------------------
Porter	,	this	whole	hating	me	thing
That	you	've	got	going	on	right	now
Believe	it	or	not	,	I	get	where	you	're	coming	from	.
I	don	't	hate	you	.
But	one	day	,
You	are	gonna	meet	someone	more	...
Appropriate	.
Someone	who	want	the	same	things	that	you	do	out	of	life	.
Then	you	are	gonna	know	what	real	love	is	.
And	when	you	do	,	I	hope	you	will	finally	see
--------------------
Where	I	am	coming	from	.
It	's	me	.
Can	you	talk	?
Hey	,	gary	.
I	'm	running	kind	of	late	.
Can	I	call	you	later	?
Just	listen	.
I	can	leave	town	saturday	.
You	have	the	money	,	right	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
No	problem	.
I	love	you	.
I	know	where	you	're	coming	from	,	mom	.
And	...
I-	i	want	you	and	dad	to	know
That	I	really	appreciate	everything	you	've	done	for	me	.
Good	.
I	'll	see	you	downstairs	.
Desire	--	It	's	an	emotion	designed	to	lead	us	astray	,
Persuading	those	who	crave	love	to	make	foolish	choices	...
--------------------
Causing	those	who	yearn	for	family
To	act	out	in	anger	...
Allowing	those	who	are	lonely	...
To	behave	in	reckless	ways	.
And	when	the	pursuit	of	our	heart	's	desire
Becomes	an	obsession	,
The	best	we	can	hope	for
Is	a	caring	friend	willing	to	come	along	...
Hi	.
I	'd	like	to	book	the	next	flight	to	fairview	.
--------------------
And	stop	us	.
My	old	man	says	cos	he	's	a	nigger	and	he	's	West	Ham	,	you	got	to	kill	the	cunt	twice	.
So	fucking	kill	the	cunt	twice	.
I	'm	gonna	take	the	black	bastard	's	fucking	head	off	!
That	was	him	.
Aim	for	his	chest	,	yeah	?
Not	his	face	.
Black	West	Ham	cunt	!
Look	,	mate	...
Come	on	.
--------------------
You	killed	the	nigger	!
...	with	this	bird	,	right	?
Up	in	her	bedroom	.
Her	old	geezer	's	fucked	off	down	the	pub	,	so	we	thinks	,	"	Lovely	.	"
So	I	started	to	try	and	get	her	bra	off	.
What	,	so	you	could	feel	her	tits	?
No	,	so	he	could	put	her	bra	on	his	head	.
Of	course	so	he	could	feel	her	tits	,	you	soppy	bastard	.
All	right	,	mate	,	I	was	only	asking	.
I	worry	about	you	,	mate	.
--------------------
Fuckin	'	hell	!
Come	on	!
Do	the	Wolves	nigger	!
We	're	West	Ham	,	mate	.
We	're	West	Ham	.
Who	're	you	?
Clive	Best	's	little	brother	?
You	ain	't	West	Ham	if	you	're	on	your	toes	with	them	Wolves	cunts	.
They	were	a	proper	naughty	firm	,	mate	.
They	just	smashed	a	load	of	West	Ham	.
--------------------
They	were	pissed	on	,	mate	.
Shut	up	,	you	little	mug	.
Show	us	where	they	are	,	or	I	'll	piss	on	you	.
They	're	only	over	there	.
Come	on	,	then	.
Let	's	go	and	fuck	'em	!
Come	on	,	then	!
Stick	together	,	yeah	?
Stick	together	.
Hello	.
--------------------
What	's	your	name	?
Aren	't	you	lovely	?
Let	's	have	a	look	at	you	.
Isn	't	he	a	sweetheart	?
Yes	,	love	,	he	's	a	real	darling	.
They	're	still	cute	at	that	age	,	in	't	they	?
Before	they	get	that	curly	hair	and	big	lips	.
Bye	,	then	,	love	.
Ignorant	cow	!
Come	on	.
--------------------
Come	on	,	son	.
You	're	going	to	be	late	again	!
Oh	,	ain	't	you	going	to	sit	down	and	eat	something	?
I	'm	going	to	be	late	,	Mum	,	like	you	said	.
Oh	,	come	on	,	son	.
I	made	your	favourite	,	specially	.
Sorry	,	Mum	.
I	ain	't	hungry	.
You	're	never	hungry	.
What	's	the	matter	with	you	?
--------------------
Cecil	,	tell	him	to	eat	something	.
Yeah	,	come	on	,	son	.
Don	't	upset	your	mother	.
I	've	got	to	go	.
What	?
Just	...
You	behave	yourself	,	you	hear	me	?
Golliwog	!
How	the	fuck	do	you	comb	that	fuzzy-	wuzzy	hair	?
Where	'd	you	come	from	,	chocolate	face	?
--------------------
Fuckin	'	blackie	!
Yeah	,	you	tell	him	,	Bill	.
Oi	,	nig-	nog	.
I	drew	a	picture	of	you	.
Want	to	see	yourself	?
And	he	's	got	a	granny	for	a	mum	,	an	'	all	.
What	happened	to	your	real	mum	,	monkey	boy	?
Don	't	you	remember	,	lads	?
We	fed	her	last	week	,	down	London	Zoo	!
Ooo	ooo	ooo	ooo	ooo	!
--------------------
My	dad	says	you	lot	should	go	back	to	where	you	come	from	.
Go	on	,	fuck	off	back	to	the	jungle	.
Fuck	off	,	Billy	,	you	gypo	!
What	you	pair	of	cunts	doing	hanging	about	with	a	darkie	for	,	anyway	?
Ain	't	you	gonna	say	nothing	?
Carol	!
Go	on	,	Cass	!
Do	him	,	Cass	!
Come	on	!
Fuck	him	up	!
--------------------
Come	on	,	he	's	nothing	!
Yeah	,	all	right	,	all	right	.
That	's	another	new	school	uniform	ruined	.
I	can	't	afford	to	buy	a	new	one	every	week	.
You	can	't	just	go	bashing	people	up	all	the	time	.
What	happens	if	someone	reports	you	to	Dr	Barnado	's	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	happens	.
They	'll	say	I	can	't	control	you	.
They	'll	take	you	away	from	me	.
Is	that	what	you	want	?
--------------------
Violence	isn	't	going	to	solve	anything	,	Carol	.
Stop	fucking	calling	me	that	name	!
Oi	!
Don	't	you	talk	to	your	mother	like	that	!
You	hear	me	?
Well	,	don	't	you	ever	call	me	Carol	again	!
I	'm	sick	of	being	tormented	for	it	.
It	's	a	girl	's	name	.
Everyone	knows	it	's	a	girl	's	name	.
Well	,	don	't	blame	me	.
--------------------
Blame	them	that	give	you	away	.
I	didn	't	give	it	ya	.
Why	can	't	you	call	me	something	else	,	then	?
Well	,	what	am	I	supposed	to	call	you	,	you	daft	sod	?
I	can	't	just	call	you	son	all	the	time	,	can	I	?
Call	me	Cass	.
Call	you	what	?
Call	me	Cass	.
Cass	?
What	's	that	?
--------------------
That	's	what	my	mates	call	me	.
Well	,	why	on	earth	do	they	call	you	Cass	?
That	's	worse	than	Carol	.
No	,	it	ain	't	.
It	's	after	that	boxer	,	Cassius	Clay	.
Oh	,	bleedin	'	hell	!
I	might	have	known	it	had	something	to	do	with	fighting	.
Yeah	,	but	he	's	the	toughest	fighter	there	is	.
Everyone	likes	him	.
People	don	't	like	you	just	cos	you	can	bash	people	up	,	son	.
--------------------
Oh	,	all	right	,	if	it	means	that	much	to	you	and	it	's	going	to	make	your	life	easier	,
I	'll	call	you	...
Cass	.
Will	you	make	the	teachers	call	me	Cass	as	well	,	then	?
But	you	got	to	promise	me	to	stay	out	of	trouble	,	OK	?
Yeah	,	but	everyone	apart	from	my	mates	think	that	all	I	am	is	just	a	darkie	.
That	is	just	ignorant	name	calling	.
That	is	not	what	you	are	.
I	'll	tell	you	what	you	are	.
You	are	my	special	boy	.
--------------------
Special	like	Cassius	Clay	?
Yeah	,	special	just	like	Cassius	Clay	.
Come	here	!
Right	,	you	pair	.
Off	you	go	.
And	don	't	let	him	take	you	down	the	pub	with	all	them	West	Ham	mates	.
No	bad	influences	,	right	?
You	take	care	of	him	,	Cecil	.
I	don	't	want	him	getting	into	any	more	trouble	.
It	's	all	right	,	Doll	.
--------------------
It	's	only	the	football	.
#	We	're	the	North	Bank	,	we	're	the	North	Bank
#	We	're	the	North	Bank	Upton	Park	!	#
You	all	right	,	fellas	?
Yes	,	mate	.
I	don	't	know	what	the	fucking	East	End	's	coming	to	,	do	you	?
Yeah	,	I	know	,	mate	.
Hey	,	steady	on	,	lads	.
He	's	just	a	little	kid	.
Gonna	fuckin	'	grow	up	though	,	ain	't	he	?
--------------------
You	all	right	,	son	?
You	looking	forward	to	the	match	,	son	?
What	's	the	special	occasion	?
Eh	?
Well	,	why	are	you	taking	me	with	you	,	all	of	a	sudden	?
Your	mother	thought	we	ought	to	spend	a	bit	more	time	together	.
Why	?
You	know	what	your	mother	's	like	,	son	.
Anyway	,	who	's	your	favourite	West	Ham	player	?
I	'm	not	sure	.
--------------------
Oh	,	come	on	.
Bobby	Moore	?
Martin	Peters	?
Geoff	Hurst	?
Don	't	know	.
Yeah	,	well	...
Don	't	matter	.
Just	remember	,	stay	close	to	me	today	.
Don	't	want	you	getting	hurt	,	right	,	Cass	?
Your	mother	'd	kill	me	.
--------------------
#	I	'm	forever	blowing	bubbles
#	Pretty	bubbles	in	the	air
#	They	fly	so	high	,	they	reach	the	sky
#	And	like	my	dreams	,	they	fade	and	die
#	Fortunes	always	hiding	...	#
Are	we	going	in	?
Yeah	,	fuck	it	,	we	're	half	in	the	firm	now	.
Oi	!
No	fucking	nig-	nogs	allowed	in	this	pub	.
You	stick	with	the	sambo	snooker	club	down	the	road	.
--------------------
Fuck	off	,	you	nonce	.
He	ain	't	a	nig-	nog	,	he	's	West	Ham	.
Don	't	just	fucking	'	stand	there	,	you	little	cunts	.
Get	in	there	and	get	me	a	pint	.
Have	a	look	.
Duran	Du-	fuckin-	ran	,	innit	?
Look	who	it	is	.
How	are	you	,	mate	?
All	right	,	all	right	.
Ray	,	mate	.
--------------------
I	thought	you	were	in	the	nick	,	mate	.
Got	bail	,	didn	't	I	?
How	much	did	they	fix	your	bail	at	,	then	?
Twenty	.
Twenty	grand	?
No	,	twenty	quid	.
Of	course	,	twenty	fucking	grand	!
Yeah	,	the	cunts	.
They	proper	stitched	me	up	this	time	.
No	way	I	'm	getting	out	of	it	.
--------------------
How	long	do	you	reckon	you	'll	get	,	then	?
Definitely	a	ten	,	but	please	God	,	out	in	five	.
Five	?
Five	years	?
Fuck	that	.
Anyway	,	I	thought	I	'd	make	the	most	of	it	while	I	can	.
Here	,	you	still	wasting	your	dough	chasing	them	Hammers	all	round	the	country	?
Too	fucking	right	,	mate	.
Slice	me	open	and	you	'll	see	my	claret	is	claret	and	fuckin	'	blue	,	mate	.
Fuckin	'	right	!
--------------------
I	just	stick	to	the	boxing	now	,	mate	.
Couldn	't	bear	to	watch	them	Hammers	get	hammered	every	fucking	week	.
Yeah	,	well	,	you	won	't	have	to	worry	about	that	for	a	while	,	will	you	,	Ray	?
What	do	you	mean	by	that	,	then	,	son	?
Nothing	,	Ray	.
I	was	only	joking	,	mate	.
You	taking	the	fucking	piss	out	of	me	?
No	.
No	,	I	'm	really	sorry	,	Ray	.
I	never	meant	nothing	by	it	,	mate	.
--------------------
Just	as	fuckin	'	well	then	,	innit	?
Fuck	me	,	kid	,	you	smell	like	you	pebble	dashed	that	seat	.
What	's	the	matter	wi	'	you	?
Pull	yourself	up	!
Fuck	me	,	Ray	.
You	fucking	shit	yourself	.
Anyway	,	look	,	good	to	see	you	,	boys	.
Cheers	.
Liven	yourself	up	,	you	,	I	'm	telling	you	.
I	need	a	brandy	after	that	.
--------------------
What	is	it	with	you	people	,	eh	?
Your	sort	are	all	the	fucking	same	.
No	good	,	and	fucking	lazy	!
Oi	!
Leave	it	.
Now	,	get	a	move	on	.
No	wonder	his	fucking	wife	left	him	.
What	a	cunt	!
Come	on	.
This	is	it	!
--------------------
Fucking	kill	'em	!
ICF	,	ICF	,	ICF	.
Come	on	then	,	you	cunt	.
Oi	!
Wake	up	,	you	lazy	cunts	.
Oi	,	come	on	,	you	pair	of	slags	.
Get	her	!
All	right	,	fuck	's	sake	!
All	right	?
Morning	.
--------------------
You	cold	?
No	,	I	ain	't	,	paperboy	.
Oh	,	hello	.
All	right	,	you	've	had	an	eyeful	.
What	's	all	the	fucking	fuss	for	?
Two	page	twos	and	a	page	four	.
Who	fucking	gave	us	a	page	four	?
Who	'd	you	think	?
Typical	.
Posh	cunts	!

Chelsea	got	front	pages	again	.
Fucking	Chelsea	!
"	Notorious	Chelsea	hooligans	.	"
What	a	load	of	fucking	bollocks	!
Here	,	listen	to	this	.
"	Mindless	thuggery	as	West	Ham	mob	attack	Leeds	pub	.	"
Mindless	?
We	fucking	planned	that	for	weeks	.
Where	's	my	fucking	top	,	Freeman	?
Renee	!
--------------------
Renee	!
My	name	ain	't	Renee	.
It	's	Tracey	.
Where	is	it	,	then	?
There	you	are	.
Oops	!
Oh	,	turn	it	in	.
Here	you	are	,	doll	.
Whoo	!
Stop	fucking	about	.
--------------------
Get	your	filthy	hands	off	it	.
Why	,	you	horrible	little	slag	!
His	fuckin	'	boyfriend	,	are	you	?
Look	,	this	is	all	my	fault	.
Here	you	are	.
Come	on	,	darling	.
Here	,	bye-	bye	.
Don	't	forget	to	put	your	lead	on	.
You	all	right	,	mate	?
Yeah	,	I	'm	all	right	.
--------------------
"	Chelsea	tops	thugs	league	.	"
What	the	fuck	's	that	about	?
It	's	a	fucking	joke	.
What	are	you	...	?
Look	here	.
Open	the	door	,	you	prick	.
Open	the	door	.
Come	on	,	you	wanker	.
I	'm	sorry	.
All	right	?
--------------------
Me	,	too	.
Now	fuck	off	and	tell	that	pikey	cunt	of	a	Millwall	boyfriend	of	yours	that	the	ICF	's	just	done	his	little	Renee	up	the	'arris	again	.
Ta-	da	.
Small	cock	,	anyway	.
Don	't	worry	about	that	slut	,	mate	.
I	don	't	give	a	shit	about	her	.
I	'm	pissed	off	with	these	fucking	kiddie	firms	stealing	all	the	headlines	again	.
Right	,	that	's	it	.
Newcastle	away	,	week	on	Saturday	.
We	'll	give	them	cunts	something	to	write	about	.
--------------------
There	.
I	want	revenge	on	those	cunts	for	the	petrol	bomb	they	threw	in	our	end	last	season	.
I	'm	surprised	they	even	have	fucking	petrol	.
Ain	't	it	coal	they	use	in	motors	up	there	?
Say	what	you	want	about	them	,	they	got	fuck	all	style	,	but	do	they	fucking	hate	Cockneys	!
They	'll	be	waiting	for	us	coming	off	the	train	,	as	usual	.
And	it	ain	't	the	best	sight	,	500	mad	Geordie	lumps	waiting	at	the	station	for	you	.
Right	.
We	'll	put	our	fucking	A-	team	on	'em	,	right	before	the	game	,	when	they	ain	't	expecting	it	.
Have	a	squint	at	them	,	then	.
--------------------
Yeah	,	they	're	not	bad	.
Ain	't	you	gonna	put	your	name	and	address	on	them	as	well	,	then	?
You	cheeky	bastard	.
Well	,	that	's	exactly	what	you	need	.
Something	to	let	these	cunts	know	exactly	who	the	fucking	top	firm	is	.
A	little	bit	more	fucking	exposure	.
You	gonna	have	a	drink	,	then	,	love	?
No	,	thank	you	very	much	.
Are	you	ready	?
Now	,	please	,	don	't	forget	just	to	look	at	me	and	not	the	camera	,	yeah	?
--------------------
Welcome	to	News	Agenda	.
Our	subject	today	is	the	English	disease	,	football	hooliganism	.
An	international	poll	recently	claimed	that	now	,	in	1983	,	after	the	Royal	Family	,	it	's	what	Britain	is	most	famous	for	.
We	've	spoken	to	several	authorities	from	the	world	of	football	,	but	today	we	're	going	to	talk	to	actual	,	real	hooligans	.
They	've	asked	to	remain	nameless	,	but	the	gentlemen	concerned	are	members	of	one	of	Britain	's	most	violent	gangs	,	the	Inter	City	Force	.
Erm	...
It	's	the	Inter	City	Firm	,	love	.
Now	,	you	're	actual	,	real	hooligans	.
Can	you	tell	me	what	it	's	like	?
so	attracted	to	such	a	violent	way	of	life	.
--------------------
All	right	?
Yeah	,	all	right	,	son	.
You	seen	me	on	TV	last	week	,	then	?
Yeah	,	we	saw	you	,	Cass	.
So	did	half	London	.
Phone	hasn	't	stopped	ringing	.
Yeah	?
Anybody	else	after	an	interview	,	then	?
Do	you	honestly	think	the	police	aren	't	going	to	come	after	you	and	your	silly	little	West	Ham	mates	?
Now	that	they	've	seen	you	mouthing	off	on	the	television	?
--------------------
What	are	you	talking	about	?
I	never	admitted	to	anything	.
And	anyway	,	I	got	good	money	for	that	.
Yeah	?
How	much	?
Fifty	quid	.
Fifty	quid	,	eh	?
Cecil	!
Don	't	bloody	encourage	him	.
Well	,	was	it	worth	it	?
--------------------
Or	are	you	going	to	tell	me	it	's	all	for	that	overblown	ego	you	value	nowadays	?
Fifty	quid	I	got	,	yeah	?
That	's	half	a	week	's	wages	.
Well	,	start	saving	,	son	.
Cos	a	good	lawyer	's	going	to	cost	you	a	hell	of	a	lot	more	than	fifty	piddling	quid	.
I	never	brought	you	up	to	be	an	'ooligan	.
Yeah	,	well	,	nobody	asked	you	to	bring	me	up	.
Well	,	nobody	asked	me	to	bring	you	up	,	either	.
I	didn	't	mean	to	say	that	.
You	don	't	know	what	it	's	like	for	me	.
--------------------
I	'm	not	like	you	.
I	don	't	want	to	be	another	worker	bee	.
I	ain	't	settling	for	that	.
I	ain	't	settling	for	a	life	like	he	's	got	.
Well	,	he	put	food	on	your	table	.
And	he	put	a	roof	over	your	head	.
And	until	you	realise	that	that	's	what	it	takes	to	make	you	a	man	,	then	you	will	never	amount	to	anything	.
Yeah	.
No	.
No	.
--------------------
Yeah	.
Yeah	.
No	.
Yeah	.
Yeah	.
Everything	,	but	everything	,	must	be	done	.
But	in	the	end	,	it	comes	to	getting	hold	of	the	perpetrators	of	these	terrible	things	.
Yeah	.
No	.
Yeah	.
--------------------
That	requires	action	by	the	Football	Association	.
If	need	be	,	it	requires	fresh	legislation	.
It	will	get	the	full	cooperation	of	the	police	,	and	it	requires	the	full	cooperation	of	the	people	in	those	clubs	,	because	they	know	who	are	their	supporters	and	they	know	who	are	not	.
Yeah	.
Yeah	.
Behave	!
We	ain	't	Crystal	fucking	Palace	!
You	what	?
Maybe	in	a	couple	of	years	,	eh	?
I	fucking	hate	them	Geordie	cunts	,	Cass	.
--------------------
I	'll	cut	'em	to	fuck	!
Oh	,	come	on	,	Cass	.
Fuck	off	,	mate	.
Fuck	me	,	that	knife	was	nearly	bigger	than	him	.
Are	you	fucking	serious	,	mate	?
Piss	off	!
I	wish	we	could	get	those	responsible	,	get	them	before	a	court	,	and	stiff	sentences	,	so	that	they	stop	anyone	else	in	their	tracks	from	doing	this	.
Now	,	that	's	what	we	want	to	do	,	because	we	want	to	make	it	a	wonderful	game	again	.
Yeah	,	go	on	.
Yeah	.
--------------------
Yeah	.
It	's	the	thugs	that	are	destroying	football	.
Johnny	Lyle	's	claret	and	Blue	Army	,	Johnny	Lyle	's	claret	and	Blue	Army	!
Johnny	Lyle	's	claret	and	Blue	Army	!
Johnny	Lyle	's	claret	and	Blue	Army	!
Johnny	Lyle	's	claret	and	Blue	Army	!
Who	wants	to	have	a	fucking	laugh	?
Come	on	.
I	said	,	who	wants	to	have	a	fucking	laugh	?
All	right	,	here	we	go	.
--------------------
How	do	you	stop	a	dog	shagging	your	leg	?
Suck	his	cock	.
Enjoy	that	,	did	you	?
You	having	a	laugh	?
Tell	your	fucking	face	,	you	miserable	cunt	,	eh	?
ICF	!
ICF	!
ICF	!
ICF	!

--------------------
East	London	,	la	la	la	,	East	London	,	la	la	la	,	East	London	,	la	la	la	#
You	all	right	,	mate	,	eh	?
Did	you	leave	Spit	the	dog	at	home	today	,	did	you	?
All	right	,	listen	.
My	wife	's	got	two	cunts	,	right	?
I	'm	one	of	them	.
Listen	up	!
We	know	who	their	top	boys	are	,	right	?
So	we	go	after	them	first	,	and	the	rest	of	them	will	fucking	crumble	!
These	cunts	don	't	fuck	about	,	we	saw	that	last	season	.
--------------------
Any	one	of	us	goes	down	for	this	,	we	all	fucking	go	there	.
This	is	the	fucking	big	one	.
There	'll	be	no	more	talk	after	this	on	who	's	the	top	firm	.
Well	,	come	on	,	you	cunts	!
What	's	got	eight	legs	and	a	big	,	black	cunt	?
The	fucking	A-	team	!
All	right	,	you	all	like	football	,	right	?
Yeah	?
You	all	like	football	?
Listen	to	'em	.
--------------------
Fuck	!
Fucking	let	me	out	!
Let	's	get	on	with	it	.
This	is	where	we	make	a	real	fucking	name	for	ourselves	,	boys	.
This	is	where	we	show	every	other	mob	in	Britain	who	the	real	fucking	daddies	are	.
Are	we	the	famous	ICF	or	what	?
Well	,	fucking	come	on	,	then	!
Ram	it	in	!
He	likes	that	one	and	all	.
What	do	you	call	a	lesbian	Paki	?
--------------------
All	right	,	Kunta	Kinte	,	sit	yourself	down	.
If	Chicken	George	is	coming	in	behind	you	,	tell	him	to	shut	his	fucking	gob	an	'	all	.
Come	on	,	then	,	you	dirty	cunts	!
Fucking	hell	!
Calm	down	,	fellas	.
This	is	Dennis	's	big	night	.
Jesus	Christ	!
Let	's	have	some	fucking	lagers	.
He	's	gone	fucking	mental	!
Jesus	fucking	Christ	!
--------------------
I	've	had	it	here	.
Right	,	well	,	good	luck	,	Dennis	.
Kiddy	firm	!
Fucking	Kiddy	firm	!
Come	on	!
Next	.
Hello	,	Harry	.
Good	afternoon	,	Ron	.
What	are	you	in	for	now	,	then	?
Got	caught	,	mate	.
--------------------
Well	,	that	'll	do	it	every	time	,	won	't	it	,	mate	?
Certainly	will	.
Cheers	.
Next	.
Extra	large	,	mate	.
No	,	thanks	.
I	'll	take	the	Lacoste	ones	,	pal	.
Yeah	?
No	,	you	fucking	won	't	,	you	cheeky	bastard	.
You	'll	have	the	ones	that	I	decide	you	're	having	.
--------------------
Listen	,	mate	,	if	I	was	doing	your	job	,	I	'd	be	a	miserable	old	cunt	an	'	all	.
But	look	at	it	this	way	.
At	least	you	get	to	go	home	and	take	a	shower	with	a	fucking	bird	.
Fucking	hell	,	you	ain	't	seen	my	missus	,	mate	.
You	'll	never	get	the	fat	old	cunt	in	the	shower	when	I	'm	in	it	.
Name	?
Pennant	.
Hold	up	.
You	're	the	hooligan	on	the	news	.
I	used	to	go	and	watch	QPR	back	in	the	day	.
--------------------
Yeah	.
Here	,	Pennant	.
Who	was	the	best	mob	you	went	up	against	,	then	?
Eh	?
Eh	?
Suit	yourself	.
Next	.
Name	?
Fuck	me	.
Have	a	word	.
--------------------
They	never	said	it	was	a	five-	star	gaff	.
All	right	,	mate	?
Suppose	I	'd	better	take	the	four	poster	,	then	?
I	want	my	draw	.
When	I	ask	you	for	a	draw	,	you	give	me	a	draw	,	you	understand	me	?
Don	't	let	me	fucking	ask	you	again	!
I	want	a	fuckin	'	draw	,	boy	.
Give	it	to	me	!
Mate	!
Mate	!
--------------------
Leave	it	out	.
What	you	saying	there	choc-	ice	?
You	what	,	mate	?
You	're	not	a	brethren	.
You	can	't	talk	to	me	,	raasclat	.
You	talk	like	a	white	man	.
Sorry	,	mate	,	me	no	understand	you	.
You	're	not	a	black	man	!
Black	?
Not	fucking	really	black	?
--------------------
Well	,	what	the	fuck	is	that	then	,	you	cunt	?
Black	power	gonna	deal	with	all	you	white	devil	...
All	you	Uncle	Tom	collaborators	.
You	've	been	watching	too	much	American	TV	.
This	is	Britain	,	mate	.
British	colonial	oppression	!
Black	man	gonna	rise	up	and	go	back	to	Africa	.
One	nation	!
Haile	Selassie	!
Kill	all	the	Babylon	then	!
--------------------
Rastafarai	!
You	'd	best	leave	your	BMW	and	gold	chains	behind	,	then	,	mate	.
Cos	there	'll	be	no	use	for	them	in	a	fucking	mud	hut	.
Raasclat	!
I	fucking	thought	Jamaicans	and	Africans	fucking	hate	each	other	,	anyway	.
Go	back	to	Africa	,	then	,	where	black	man	is	killing	black	man	.
And	take	that	fucking	chip	on	your	shoulder	with	you	.
But	there	'll	be	no	more	playing	the	rude	boy	in	the	nightclubs	,	and	fucking	white	pussy	,	you	racist	fucking	hypocrite	!
Fucking	Dimlo	!
Fucking	put	me	in	with	fucking	cunts	like	...
--------------------
Come	on	,	then	,	you	cunt	!
Come	on	,	then	.
Fucking	slice	me	.
Why	fucking	stop	it	?
I	don	't	want	to	share	my	cell	with	a	white	honkie	hooligan	.
Mmm	,	new	boy	always	rolls	.
What	?
Problem	?
Sorry	,	mate	.
I	don	't	know	how	.
--------------------
All	my	years	inside	,	me	never	meet	a	black	man	that	can	't	skin	up	.
I	know	,	and	it	gets	worse	.
The	fucking	screws	think	I	'm	a	fucking	schwartze	,	and	the	rastas	think	I	'm	a	fucking	coconut	.
You	ever	look	in	the	mirror	to	check	what	colour	you	are	,	hooligan	?
Look	,	mate	,	I	ain	't	no	Uncle	Tom	,	all	right	?
I	bet	I	've	had	more	stick	for	being	black	than	you	.
Hey	,	chill	,	chill	it	,	hooligan	.
Look	,	mate	.
My	mum	was	a	50-	year-	old	white	woman	when	she	brought	me	home	from	the	orphanage	.
Nobody	gave	her	an	instruction	manual	on	how	to	bring	up	a	black	kid	.
--------------------
How	's	she	supposed	to	know	about	plaiting	up	your	hair	and	moisturising	your	skin	?
I	never	thought	about	it	like	that	,	mate	.
Well	,	I	did	.
Every	fucking	day	.
Oh	,	you	don	't	understand	patois	,	then	?
Yeah	,	mate	.
Just	like	you	don	't	understand	Japanese	.
Why	the	fuck	do	you	still	speak	that	bollocks	,	anyway	?
It	's	in	my	heritage	,	man	.
I	mean	,	I	only	speak	it	with	my	mother	,	you	know	,	and	in	here	,	just	to	piss	off	the	screws	.
--------------------
You	got	a	lot	to	learn	about	your	culture	,	Mr	Hooligan	.
The	only	culture	I	got	is	West	Ham	fucking	United	.
Someone	wants	a	word	with	the	hooligan	.
Come	on	.
What	the	fuck	's	going	on	here	?
I	ain	't	done	nothing	.
Fucking	hell	!
Here	he	is	,	the	big	man	.
How	are	you	?
Come	on	,	sit	down	.
--------------------
I	thought	you	was	in	Wandsworth	.
Yeah	,	I	am	sometimes	,	but	you	know	what	these	fuckers	are	like	.
They	like	to	keep	you	on	the	move	,	stop	you	from	getting	too	cosy	.
It	don	't	seem	to	have	taken	you	long	to	get	your	feet	under	the	table	in	here	,	though	.
Yeah	,	well	,	you	can	talk	.
In	all	the	newspapers	.
So	what	are	you	,	then	?
The	world	's	first	celebrity	football	thug	?
So	,	how	are	you	settling	in	?
Oh	,	don	't	.
--------------------
Well	,	you	know	what	they	say	.
The	first	couple	of	months	are	always	the	hardest	.
You	'll	be	all	right	.
How	long	did	you	get	?
Four	year	.
Fuck	me	.
Four	years	for	fighting	for	a	poxy	football	club	.
I	know	.
It	weren	't	even	a	game	,	either	.
Fucking	liberty	,	mate	.
--------------------
Don	't	worry	,	you	'll	be	out	in	two	.
What	's	all	this	about	an	Inter	City	Firm	?
Whatever	happened	to	the	old	South	Bank	Crew	or	the	Mile	End	?
What	do	you	mean	?
Where	's	the	money	in	it	?
Who	's	the	guvnor	?
There	's	no	real	guvnor	,	really	.
It	's	just	a	few	of	us	who	organise	it	,	and	a	few	firms	come	together	under	one	banner	.
Where	does	the	money	come	from	?
Protection	?
--------------------
Gear	?
No	,	there	's	no	money	in	it	.
Unless	you	count	the	under-	fives	for	taxing	some	poor	cunt	for	his	Burberry	.
A	bunch	of	fucking	wannabes	,	if	you	ask	me	,	Cass	.
How	many	bodies	can	you	get	together	at	any	given	time	?
Depends	what	's	going	on	.
Anything	from	nifty	to	a	carpet	.
And	that	's	hardcore	.
No	hangers-	on	.
Another	couple	of	ton	if	it	's	a	big	one	.
--------------------
Fuck	me	,	that	ain	't	bad	.
So	what	are	you	,	then	?
Some	kind	of	a	black	hooligan	pope	or	something	?
Or	the	Pied	Piper	of	Plaistow	?
Listen	,	I	'm	being	serious	here	,	mate	.
If	you	're	interested	,	I	might	have	a	little	bit	of	graft	for	you	on	the	out	.
Cheers	for	the	offer	,	mate	,	but	I	ain	't	into	anything	criminal	,	yeah	?
What	the	fuck	do	you	think	you	're	doing	in	here	then	,	you	silly	bastard	?
Anyway	,	who	said	anything	about	it	being	criminal	?
We	're	businessmen	.
--------------------
Right	,	go	on	.
You	better	fuck	off	now	.
I	'll	think	about	it	,	yeah	?
This	lot	can	't	be	all	fucking	true	,	Cass	.
Fuck	off	,	mate	.
Every	fucking	word	.
It	ain	't	half	bad	,	you	know	.
Where	was	your	family	from	?
Both	from	somewhere	in	London	.
Not	quite	sure	exactly	where	,	though	.
--------------------
No	,	mate	.
Your	real	family	.
They	are	my	real	family	.
The	only	ones	that	ever	wanted	me	.
You	never	try	and	find	the	others	?
I	ain	't	interested	,	mate	.
What	good	would	that	do	me	?
Listen	,	don	't	take	the	wrong	way	,	right	?
But	I	think	that	's	where	your	real	problem	is	.
Don	't	take	this	the	wrong	way	either	,	mate	,	but	fuck	off	.
--------------------
Look	,	if	you	don	't	know	who	your	father	was	,	and	you	don	't	know	who	your	grandfather	was	,	how	are	you	supposed	to	know	where	your	roots	are	,	who	you	are	?
Who	the	fuck	are	you	?
Mother	Teresa	?
What	the	fuck	would	a	petty	criminal	like	you	know	anything	about	stuff	like	that	,	anyway	?
If	you	had	any	brains	,	you	certainly	wouldn	't	be	in	here	.
You	might	be	right	there	,	you	know	,	mate	.
But	the	one	thing	about	being	in	here	,	it	gives	you	plenty	of	time	to	think	.
Pennant	.
Whoa	,	whoa	.
What	's	that	?
--------------------
Just	things	I	've	been	scribbling	down	.
Give	it	here	.
Prison	rule	12	.	786	states	that	no	inmate	is	permitted	to	be	discharged	with	any	possession	that	he	did	not	enter	the	prison	with	.
Oh	,	come	on	,	mate	.
I	certainly	am	not	your	mate	.
I	've	been	writing	that	for	ages	.
That	's	my	life	.
What	does	that	say	,	sonny	?
Her	Majesty	's	Prison	.
Exactly	.
--------------------
Property	of	Her	Majesty	.
Not	...
Carol	Pennant	.
Come	on	,	then	.
Let	's	see	if	we	can	find	out	if	you	fight	like	a	girl	as	well	,	Carol	.
Cos	if	we	do	,	then	you	'll	be	heading	straight	back	down	that	fucking	corridor	,	back	into	the	cosy	little	cave	you	've	just	crawled	out	of	.
That	's	my	future	you	just	slung	away	.
Future	?
Tell	me	,	what	fucking	future	is	there	,	exactly	,	for	a	two-	bit	schwartze	football	hooligan	like	you	?
Hope	to	see	you	back	here	soon	...
--------------------
Carol	.
I	don	't	know	why	I	ever	agreed	to	come	here	.
My	dad	would	kill	me	if	he	knew	I	was	coming	to	some	football	thug	's	party	.
Sorry	,	Linda	.
I	ain	't	waiting	here	all	day	just	to	cheer	on	some	released	convict	.
Come	on	,	Elaine	,	he	's	West	Ham	!
What	?
You	think	I	give	a	shit	about	your	crappy	little	football	team	?
It	's	too	late	,	anyway	.
Here	he	is	.
--------------------
Hello	.
Welcome	back	,	son	.
Good	to	have	you	back	,	son	.
Is	that	him	?
That	cocky-	looking	geezer	?
Go	on	,	then	.
Speech	!
Speech	!
Hey	,	hey	,	come	on	!
Speech	!
--------------------
Come	on	,	Cass	.
Dunno	what	to	say	,	really	.
That	's	a	fucking	first	,	then	.
Glad	to	see	you	ain	't	lost	it	,	mate	.
Can	't	lose	it	if	you	never	had	it	.
I	'd	just	like	to	say	thanks	to	everybody	for	coming	down	here	tonight	,	and	for	everybody	who	came	to	visit	me	inside	.
When	you	're	in	there	,	even	a	stupid	thing	like	a	postcard	can	help	keep	you	going	.
So	,	to	all	of	youse	that	wrote	,	and	I	know	most	of	you	can	't	...
I	won	't	forget	it	.
That	's	about	it	,	really	.
--------------------
Who	've	we	got	,	Saturday	,	then	?
All	right	,	sexy	?
All	right	.
You	on	your	own	,	then	,	darling	?
Yeah	,	you	know	how	it	is	,	I	'm	sure	.
You	want	to	come	for	a	toot	?
Sorry	,	I	don	't	use	that	stuff	.
I	already	have	a	personality	,	thank	you	.
You	off	,	then	,	darling	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
You	got	me	all	flushed	,	darling	.
I	need	a	little	breather	.
You	dirty	little	cunt	!
What	's	wrong	?
Cheeky	bastard	tried	to	stick	his	hands	down	my	knickers	.
Wanker	.
Calm	down	.
I	was	only	mucking	about	.
Anyway	,	she	looked	like	she	was	up	for	it	.
You	fucking	prick	!
--------------------
You	fucking	little	slag	!
Shut	your	mouth	!
Fucking	cunts	!
I	think	you	'd	better	fuck	off	home	,	mate	.
Home	?
Fuck	off	home	?
This	is	my	fucking	home	,	mate	.
Where	exactly	would	you	say	yours	was	,	eh	?
All	right	,	mate	.
No	problem	.
--------------------
I	don	't	want	no	fucking	trouble	,	all	right	?
Yeah	,	walk	on	.
Ain	't	you	going	to	do	him	?
I	thought	you	was	supposed	to	be	this	big	fucking	hard	man	.
Look	,	he	ain	't	worth	it	.
That	's	fucking	out	of	order	.
Listen	,	are	you	all	right	?
No	.
Listen	,	love	,	do	you	want	a	drink	?
White	wine	.
--------------------
I	'm	Cass	.
Are	you	?
Come	on	.
Now	remember	,	Doll	.
You	promised	.
What	's	for	dinner	,	then	,	Mum	?
Done	me	favourite	,	have	you	?
Hello	,	son	.
Welcome	home	.
It	's	two	weeks	,	that	's	all	.
--------------------
Didn	't	they	feed	you	in	there	,	then	?
You	want	to	get	a	job	now	,	keep	your	head	down	.
Give	us	a	break	.
I	only	got	out	yesterday	.
Well	,	I	just	hope	you	've	learnt	your	lesson	.
Learnt	my	lesson	?
What	are	you	talking	about	now	,	then	?
Well	,	don	't	try	and	pretend	you	was	an	angel	,	son	.
It	was	only	a	matter	of	time	before	you	got	put	away	for	something	or	other	.
Do	you	ever	give	it	a	rest	?
--------------------
They	're	saying	they	're	going	to	make	a	real	example	of	you	football	louts	,	now	that	them	poor	Italians	got	killed	.
It	's	time	you	told	him	,	Doll	.
Told	me	what	,	Mum	?
You	've	got	to	tell	him	,	Doll	.
What	?
Well	...
Trying	to	contact	you	.
Who	?
Them	that	give	you	away	.
They	've	been	writing	you	letters	.
--------------------
Through	Doctor	Barnado	's	.
Fuck	them	!
Oi	,	language	,	son	.
Not	in	front	of	your	mother	.
Don	't	you	want	to	open	them	,	then	?
No	,	I	don	't	want	nothing	to	do	with	them	.
You	two	are	my	family	.
Are	you	sure	?
You	heard	him	,	Cecil	.
He	don	't	want	to	know	.
--------------------
We	're	his	family	.
Not	them	.
You	need	to	settle	down	,	meet	a	nice	girl	,	have	a	family	of	your	own	.
Well	,	I	have	met	this	one	girl	.
Oh	?
See	?
That	's	what	you	need	,	love	of	a	good	woman	!
You	're	better	than	all	this	football	nonsense	,	son	.
You	could	really	be	somebody	.
You	're	not	stupid	,	Cass	.
--------------------
I	hope	she	is	,	though	.
Just	you	behave	yourself	.
Look	at	the	state	of	him	.
Yeah	,	I	know	.
You	all	right	,	mate	?
Yeah	.
So	what	does	this	bird	do	,	then	?
Fuck	knows	.
Travel	agent	or	something	.
Oh	,	right	.
--------------------
Do	you	think	she	could	get	us	a	cheap	deal	?
Steady	on	,	mate	.
It	's	my	first	night	,	for	fuck	's	sake	.
Remember	,	Cass	,	you	can	't	trust	none	of	them	,	mate	.
You	got	to	use	the	three	Fs	rule	with	any	Renee	.
What	's	that	,	then	?
Find	em	,	fuck	'em	,	forget	'em	.
Yeah	?
Quid	says	he	gets	fuck	all	.
You	cunts	?
--------------------
Are	you	taking	the	piss	?
Yeah	?
Are	you	taking	the	piss	?
All	right	,	lads	,	I	got	to	shoot	.
And	I	'll	have	that	,	an	'	all	.
Good	luck	,	Cass	.
It	's	all	right	,	I	nicked	it	off	him	anyway	.
How	's	your	mate	?
Who	,	Linda	?
Fine	.
--------------------
Her	pride	's	hurt	,	more	than	anything	else	.
She	'll	be	all	right	.
I	'm	surprised	you	never	smacked	that	geezer	after	what	he	said	to	you	.
Yeah	,	me	,	too	.
Are	you	the	old-	fashioned	type	,	then	?
"	No-	one	hits	a	woman	when	I	'm	around	.	"
Yeah	,	must	be	.
I	suppose	I	'm	glad	you	never	bashed	the	National	Front	cunt	.
Even	if	he	probably	deserved	it	.
Yeah	,	he	probably	did	.
--------------------
Have	you	guys	decided	yet	?
Yeah	.
I	'll	have	the	mezes	,	please	,	and	the	shish	kebab	.
And	can	I	have	an	ouzo	,	please	?
And	for	you	,	sir	?
Yeah	,	I	'll	have	that	as	well	,	please	.
Would	you	like	any	side	dishes	with	the	shish	?
Some	taramasalata	,	please	.
For	you	,	sir	?
Same	,	please	.
--------------------
Thank	you	.
Do	you	like	mezes	,	then	?
Yeah	.
You	?
Yeah	.
I	like	the	sheep	's	testicles	best	.
Do	you	?
Mmm	,	yeah	.
You	've	never	had	mezes	before	,	have	you	,	Cass	?
No	,	I	've	never	been	outside	the	country	,
--------------------
let	alone	eat	a	pair	of	Greek	sheep	's	bollocks	.
They	ain	't	seriously	going	to	bring	out	a	pair	of	lamb	's	nuts	,	are	they	?
I	don	't	want	to	sound	too	keen	or	nothing	.
But	I	got	to	tell	you	,	Cass	,	I	can	't	get	involved	with	you	if	you	're	going	to	still	be	running	around	at	weekends	fighting	like	a	bunch	of	kids	.
My	mum	and	dad	would	kill	me	.
What	are	your	old	pair	like	?
Are	they	all	right	?
God	knows	how	I	'm	going	to	explain	you	to	'em	.
What	,	cos	of	the	football	thing	?
That	as	well	,	but	...
--------------------
Well	,	let	's	just	say	they	're	old-	fashioned	.
What	?
Ain	't	they	met	a	big	,	scary	black	man	before	?
Not	really	.
It	's	more	ignorance	than	anything	nasty	.
Where	the	hell	are	our	drinks	?
Calm	down	.
Give	'em	a	chance	to	pour	'em	.
You	having	a	good	look	,	mate	?
Don	't	want	to	take	a	fucking	photo	or	something	?
--------------------
Sorry	,	Cass	.
Sorry	,	mate	.
I	was	telling	the	missus	about	when	we	took	the	Holte	End	up	in	Villa	.
Oh	,	shit	.
Sorry	,	mate	,	I	thought	you	were	looking	at	us	cos	of	...
No	,	no	,	not	at	all	.
It	's	difficult	to	tell	with	some	people	sometimes	.
Not	me	.
Argh	!
Shit	!
--------------------
Fuckin	'	hell	!
Prentice	just	took	a	right	hiding	off	some	Gooners	.
Gooners	?
Since	when	did	they	have	a	fucking	mob	?
I	'm	telling	you	,	Cass	,	he	's	bad	,	mate	.
How	bad	?
They	cut	him	to	ribbons	.
He	needed	over	a	thousand	stitches	.
A	thousand	?
What	'd	they	do	him	with	,	a	fucking	chainsaw	?
--------------------
Poor	cunt	looks	like	he	's	been	in	some	fucking	horror	film	or	something	.
I	'd	better	be	off	.
Are	you	all	right	,	Elaine	?
What	the	fuck	are	you	playing	at	,	Cass	?
You	what	?
I	thought	it	was	you	that	said	no	slush	on	the	firm	.
She	ain	't	that	fucking	special	anyway	,	mate	.
You	fucking	what	?
Fuck	's	sake	!
When	we	got	Arsenal	next	?
--------------------
Forget	it	,	mate	.
They	'll	be	all	over	it	.
It	'll	need	to	be	away	from	football	.
They	'll	never	show	up	after	this	anyway	.
What	firm	done	him	?
Some	little	mob	out	of	Islington	.
Fucking	liberty	taking	cunts	!
They	targeted	him	,	Cass	.
It	's	all	getting	personal	,	mate	.
Just	let	the	dust	settle	,	right	?
--------------------
We	'll	pick	our	time	carefully	.
We	got	to	do	'em	,	mate	.
We	got	to	do	'em	.
I	know	we	got	to	do	'em	.
Just	take	your	fucking	time	,	all	right	?
Who	'd	have	thought	you	'd	end	up	with	some	ex-	convict	?
When	's	the	wedding	?
I	should	get	a	new	hat	.
Well	,	what	's	wrong	,	mate	?
Just	this	whole	stupid	West	Ham	thing	.
--------------------
Oi	,	steady	on	!
I	just	mean	all	the	violence	.
They	're	like	bloody	kids	in	the	playground	.
What	do	you	expect	him	to	do	when	one	of	his	closest	mates	gets	his	face	opened	up	?
What	would	you	do	if	it	was	me	?
Yeah	,	but	where	's	it	gonna	end	up	,	Lind	?
It	's	just	going	to	keep	going	on	until	someone	gets	fucking	killed	.
You	really	do	like	him	,	don	't	you	?
That	's	the	whole	bloody	problem	.
Morning	,	gentlemen	.
--------------------
Remember	me	?
Cass	?
Come	on	!
You	fucking	...	!
We	fucking	done	'em	!
Fucking	Gooner	cunts	!
Eh	?
Come	on	!
Fucking	wankers	!
He	's	cut	me	knuckles	with	his	teeth	.
--------------------
You	want	to	get	up	the	doctor	's	with	that	,	mate	.
No	,	it	's	just	a	little	scratch	.
I	never	saw	the	fucking	cunt	coming	.
He	jumped	up	from	underneath	me	.
He	could	have	cut	my	fucking	balls	off	.
I	wish	he	had	cut	your	balls	off	,	you	bastard	!
Elaine	...
Sorry	,	mate	.
You	're	on	your	own	.
I	'd	rather	go	with	Millwall	on	me	tod	than	face	that	.
--------------------
Yeah	.
See	you	later	,	Cass	.
You	all	right	?
All	right	?
No	,	I	ain	't	fucking	all	right	!
Look	at	the	state	of	you	!
You	promised	me	.
You	promised	you	'd	finished	with	all	that	shit	.
What	?
What	?
--------------------
What	?
Don	't	fucking	what	me	,	all	right	?
Can	't	you	just	give	it	up	?
You	're	a	grown	man	,	Cass	.
I	'm	not	a	fucking	junkie	,	Elaine	.
You	're	talking	to	me	like	I	'm	a	fucking	smackhead	.
That	's	exactly	what	you	are	.
A	fucking	violence	addict	.
Fucking	bollocks	,	Elaine	.
I	'm	not	your	fucking	mum	,	Cass	.
--------------------
I	'm	not	there	just	to	tend	to	your	wounds	after	every	fucking	fight	.
I	love	you	,	but	I	don	't	want	to	bring	up	my	kids	with	a	dad	who	ain	't	there	.
Aw	,	look	,	I	ain	't	going	back	inside	.
I	done	me	time	.
And	who	said	anything	about	having	kids	?
I	'm	not	talking	about	going	to	prison	.
You	keep	going	the	way	you	are	,	it	won	't	be	a	cell	they	'll	be	locking	you	away	in	,	it	'll	be	a	fucking	wooden	box	.
And	anyway	,	too	late	about	the	kids	thing	,	mate	.
Eh	?
Eh	!
--------------------
Eh	!
I	can	't	believe	I	'm	having	a	baby	with	a	fucking	football	thug	.
Fucking	hell	.
Yeah	,	fucking	hell	!
How	're	we	going	to	survive	on	the	dole	if	I	have	to	stop	working	?
You	've	got	to	at	least	try	and	get	some	kind	of	a	job	,	Cass	.
How	's	a	black	,	ex-	con	hooligan	going	to	find	a	job	over	the	rest	of	Maggie	's	millions	?
I	don	't	bloody	know	.
You	're	supposed	to	be	the	one	with	all	the	big	ideas	.
You	still	running	round	playing	toy	soldiers	,	then	?
--------------------
No	,	not	really	,	Ray	.
Trying	to	keep	a	low	profile	on	that	one	.
They	're	talking	long	fucking	stretches	if	you	get	done	at	the	football	.
Chelsea	got	done	the	other	day	,	dawn	raids	.
It	's	only	a	matter	of	time	before	they	start	on	us	.
The	Old	Bill	got	his	own	...
What	do	you	want	,	then	,	mate	?
I	got	a	proposition	for	you	.
I	'm	listening	.
Remember	you	said	you	'd	have	a	bit	of	work	when	...
--------------------
Cut	the	bollocks	,	Cass	.
What	do	you	want	?
Let	me	run	your	doors	for	you	.
Go	on	.
How	many	clubs	you	got	now	?
Enough	.
Well	,	say	I	supply	all	enough	clubs	with	the	best	doormen	in	London	,	and	you	only	have	to	deal	with	me	,	saves	you	fucking	about	with	all	the	different	firms	you	got	.
Cuts	out	all	that	shit	.
One	contact	,	one	invoice	,	one	firm	.
Eh	?
--------------------
So	who	're	you	going	on	about	,	then	?
Your	five	hundred	football	squaddies	?
Some	of	them	,	yeah	.
But	not	just	them	,	all	different	kinds	of	cunts	.
It	's	courses	for	horses	,	that	kind	of	thing	.
And	it	's	not	just	a	numbers	game	,	mate	.
You	got	to	pick	the	right	heads	for	the	right	clubs	.
Eh	?
OK	.
I	'll	think	about	it	and	let	you	know	.
--------------------
All	right	.
I	'll	leave	it	with	you	.
Three	more	,	please	,	Joe	.
OK	,	Cass	.
Only	thing	is	,	you	got	to	wear	a	suit	.
A	fucking	suit	?
"	A	fucking	suit	?	"	Yes	,	a	fucking	suit	.
I	ain	't	got	a	suit	.
Oh	,	come	on	,	you	must	have	some	kind	of	suit	.
I	've	got	my	court	suit	,	but	...
--------------------
There	you	go	.
It	ain	't	a	fashion	show	,	mate	.
Fucking	suit	!
And	a	bow	tie	.
Fucking	cunt	!
Look	,	just	look	fucking	smart	,	all	right	?
You	bastard	.
I	'm	always	fucking	smart	.
Him	,	fucking	smart	?
He	's	a	joke	,	ain	't	he	?
--------------------
Cheers	,	Joe	.
OK	,	lads	.
Cheers	,	mate	.
Having	a	good	night	,	so	far	?
We	're	leaving	Downing	Street	for	the	last	time	,	after	eleven	and	a	half	wonderful	years	...
Back	of	the	queue	,	mate	.
Come	on	,	mate	.
What	?
All	right	,	fuck	off	!
Where	'd	you	get	them	crackers	,	dear	?
--------------------
Lovely	!
Here	,	look	at	that	,	Cecil	.
I	only	picked	'em	up	cheap	.
Marks	and	Sparks	,	eh	?
Ooh	!
That	's	quality	,	that	is	.
I	'll	be	all	embarrassed	when	you	come	round	to	ours	next	year	.
We	only	get	ours	out	of	the	catalogue	.
Ah	,	Cass	!
Would	you	look	at	them	!
--------------------
What	an	'andsome	pair	!
Look	at	the	clobber	on	him	,	Cecil	.
So	,	work	going	well	,	is	it	,	son	?
All	right	,	Dad	,	yeah	.
Are	you	keeping	out	of	trouble	,	though	?
I	've	always	been	a	good	boy	,	Mum	.
He	's	doing	really	well	,	Doll	.
You	should	be	very	proud	of	him	.
He	's	a	manager	now	,	you	know	.
Manager	,	eh	?
--------------------
Ooh	.
If	he	can	afford	them	crackers	,	he	must	be	doing	something	right	.
Bloody	hell	!
Who	else	?
You	should	've	got	a	bigger	turkey	,	love	.
All	right	,	it	's	me	.
Yeah	,	Happy	Christmas	to	you	,	an	'	all	.
Who	are	we	playing	?
I	'll	probably	watch	it	down	the	pub	.
Listen	...
--------------------
Oi	,	listen	.
You	'll	never	guess	who	I	clocked	on	the	door	at	this	shithole	club	in	south	London	last	night	.
That	big	black	bastard	.
No	.
Oi	,	you	're	not	listening	.
"	That	"	big	black	bastard	.
Are	you	going	to	be	late	again	?
If	I	'm	not	back	,	tape	Match	Of	The	Day	for	us	,	would	you	,	Elaine	?
Martin	,	tape	the	football	for	your	daddy	,	please	.
Your	mum	don	't	know	how	to	use	the	video	.
--------------------
Right	,	you	.
Bed	.
Cheers	,	mate	.
Keep	the	change	,	yeah	?
All	right	,	lads	?
Full	house	again	,	yeah	?
It	was	a	full	house	till	he	slung	half	of	them	out	.
Ray	's	looking	for	you	.
Eh	?
Well	,	it	better	be	cos	he	wants	to	fucking	up	my	wages	.
--------------------
You	black	West	Ham	cunt	!
Look	,	mate	...
Fucking	hell	!
Come	on	.
You	killed	the	nigger	.
Where	are	the	kids	?
They	're	in	bed	.
They	're	all	right	.
Let	's	sit	down	.
Well	?
--------------------
Doctor	says	he	's	very	lucky	to	still	be	alive	.
They	reckon	it	's	too	early	to	say	about	any	permanent	damage	he	may	have	.
Thank	you	.
We	found	him	,	you	know	.
Just	give	me	the	nod	and	it	's	done	.
Look	,	I	know	it	must	be	difficult	,	what	you	're	going	through	,	but	just	give	it	a	bit	'a	thought	,	let	me	know	,	and	I	'll	take	care	of	it	,	all	right	?
How	are	you	doing	,	then	?
All	right	,	Dad	.
Where	's	Mum	?
How	are	you	doing	?
--------------------
Not	bad	.
Where	's	Mum	?
I	've	got	some	bad	news	for	you	,	son	.
Delivery	for	Mr	Pennant	.
Sorry	for	your	loss	.
Thanks	.
Let	us	pray	.
Our	Father	,	which	art	in	heaven	,	hallowed	be	thy	name	.
Thy	kingdom	come	,	thy	will	be	done	on	earth	as	it	is	in	heaven	.
Give	us	this	day	our	daily	bread	,	and	forgive	us	our	trespasses	,	as	we	forgive	them	that	trespass	against	us	.
--------------------
Lead	us	not	into	temptation	,	but	deliver	us	from	evil	.
For	thine	is	the	kingdom	,	the	power	and	the	glory	,	for	ever	and	ever	,	Amen	.
It	's	at	this	point	that	I	should	like	to	invite	any	family	member	who	wishes	to	say	a	few	words	to	please	come	forward	.
I	'm	dreadfully	sorry	,	but	it	really	is	only	family	members	who	we	permit	to	speak	at	this	point	in	the	service	.
But	I	'm	her	son	.
Please	.
Dear	Mum	,
I	never	,	ever	thanked	you	after	all	that	you	did	for	me	.
I	never	once	told	you	that	I	loved	you	,	after	all	the	love	you	gave	me	.
I	never	even	said	goodbye	when	I	knew	it	was	near	the	end	.
--------------------
You	need	to	hear	this	,	Mum	.
Thank	you	.
Going	for	a	drink	,	then	?
No	,	I	'd	best	be	off	.
I	'm	going	to	miss	her	,	son	.
You	must	open	those	letters	now	,	Cass	.
I	threw	them	away	.
You	look	after	yourself	,	right	?
Don	't	go	doing	nothing	stupid	,	do	you	hear	?
You	all	right	,	mate	?
--------------------
We	're	going	to	get	that	cunt	.
You	know	that	,	don	't	you	?
This	one	's	down	to	me	.
I	'll	be	in	touch	,	all	right	?
Hello	?
Hello	.
Hello	.
Fucking	bastards	!
You	fucking	bastard	!
Fucking	...	!
--------------------
Go	on	,	Cass	.
Do	him	,	Cass	.
Elaine	,	would	you	get	the	door	?
Elaine	!
I	'm	coming	!
It	's	the	police	again	.
Do	you	want	me	to	stay	?
Go	upstairs	.
Are	you	sure	?
Go	upstairs	!
--------------------
How	many	times	have	I	got	to	repeat	it	?
I	told	you	already	,
I	got	no	idea	who	the	cunt	is	.
With	all	due	respect	,	sir	,	we	've	got	an	attempted	murder	suspect	out	there	,	running	around	with	a	firearm	.
He	must	know	half	of	East	London	visited	you	in	hospital	,	so	who	's	he	going	to	fear	most	?
You	suit	yourself	,	Sherlock	,	but	this	is	all	coming	from	you	,	not	me	,	all	right	?
I	ain	't	got	a	clue	.
That	'll	be	all	for	now	,	then	,	sir	.
Black	West	Ham	cunt	!
Stop	it	!
--------------------
Stop	it	!
Stop	it	!
Bloody	hell	,	Cass	.
You	can	't	just	shout	at	him	like	that	.
Fuck	off	!
Leave	me	alone	!
All	right	,	I	will	leave	you	alone	.
I	'm	going	to	take	the	kids	to	Linda	's	.
And	I	am	warning	you	,	Cass	,	if	you	're	planning	on	doing	that	no-	mark	runt	that	shot	you	,	I	ain	't	coming	back	.
Hello	,	Carol	.
--------------------
What	's	wrong	,	Carol	?
I	thought	you	were	the	tough	guy	.
You	were	when	you	nearly	killed	my	brother	.
Ain	't	you	gonna	do	me	an	'	all	,	Carol	?
Shoot	me	in	the	head	,	Carol	,	eh	?
Eh	?
What	's	wrong	?
Aren	't	you	man	enough	,	Carol	?
Come	on	,	then	.
Fucking	finish	me	off	.
--------------------
Didn	't	you	like	the	flowers	,	Carol	?
Another	one	,	Dave	,	yeah	?
And	for	me	.
Where	's	me	fucking	nuts	?
Shall	we	go	and	tell	Daddy	we	miss	him	?
Yeah	?
Gonna	be	nice	to	him	?
He	's	left	the	bloody	door	open	.
Cass	?
Dave	!
--------------------
Where	is	it	?
Come	on	!
Come	on	.
Fucking	hurry	up	.
Cass	?
Smiles	mate	,	she	don	't	fuckin	'	smile	.
She	only	smiles	when	she	's	got	one	right	up	her	.
Did	you	hear	that	?
You	ain	't	gonna	fucking	stand	for	that	,	are	you	?
Oh	,	my	God	!
--------------------
Cass	?
Sit	down	and	fucking	behave	yourself	before	you	catch	a	cold	.
Now	!
You	said	this	one	's	down	to	you	.
Do	him	,	Cass	.
Go	on	,	fucking	do	him	.
Ain	't	you	gonna	do	him	?
Choose	life	.
Choose	a	job	.
Choose	a	career	.
--------------------
Choose	a	family	.
Choose	a	fucking	big	television	.
Choose	washing	machines	,	cars	,	compact-	disc	players	,	and	electrical	tin	openers	.
Gangway	!
Run	!
Choose	good	health,	low	cholesterol	,	and	dental	insurance	.
Choose	fixed-	interest	mortgage	payments	.
Choose	a	starter	home	.
Choose	your	friends	.
Choose	leisure	wear	and	matching	luggage	.
--------------------
Choose	a	three-	piece	suite	on	hire	purchase	in	a	range	of	fucking	fabrics	.
Chose	D.	I.	Y.	and	wondering	who	the	fuck	you	are	on	a	Sunday	morning	.
Choose	sitting	on	that	couch	watching	mind-	numbing	,	spirit-	crushing	game	shows	...	stuffing	fucking	junk	food	into	your	mouth	.
Jammy	goal	!
Choose	rotting	away	at	the	end	of	it	all	.
Pissing	your	last	in	a	miserable	home	;	nothing	more	than	an	embarrassment	...	to	the	selfish	,	fucked-	up	brats	that	you	've	spawned	to	replace	yourself	.
Choose	your	future	.
Choose	life	.
But	why	would	I	want	to	do	a	thing	like	that	?
I	chose	not	to	choose	life	.
--------------------
I	chose	something	else	.
And	the	reasons	?
There	are	no	reasons	.
Who	needs	reasons	when	you	've	got	heroin	?
"	Goldfinger	's	"	better	than	"	Dr.	No	.	"
Both	of	them	are	a	lot	better	than	"	Diamonds	Are	Forever	.	"
A	judgment	reflected	in	its	relatively	poor	showing	at	the	box	office	.
And	in	which	field	,	of	course	...
"	Thunderball	"	was	a	notable	success	.
People	think	it	's	all	about	misery	and	desperation	...	and	death	and	all	that	shite	,	which	is	not	to	be	ignored	.
--------------------
Fuck	off	!
Jealous	cunt	.
But	what	they	forget	is	the	pleasure	of	it	.
They	're	all	dead	,	right	,	mate	?
Otherwise	we	wouldn	't	do	it	.
Do	you	want	me	to	?
Yeah	.
Pure	as	the	driven	snow	,	that	shit	you	done	.
After	all	,	we	're	not	fucking	stupid	.
At	least	we	're	not	that	fucking	stupid	.
--------------------
Take	the	best	orgasm	you	've	ever	had	...	multiply	it	by	a	thousand	,	and	you	're	still	nowhere	near	it	.
It	beats	any	meat	injection	.
That	beats	any	fucking	cock	in	the	world	.
When	you	're	on	junk	,	you	have	only	one	worry	:	scoring	.
And	when	you	're	off	it	,	you	're	suddenly	obliged	to	worry	about	all	sorts	of	other	shite	.
Got	no	money	,	can	't	get	drunk	.
Got	money	,	drinkin	'	too	much	.
Can	't	get	a	girl	,	no	chance	of	a	ride	.
Got	a	girl	,	too	much	hassle	.
You	have	to	worry	about	bills	,	about	food	...	about	some	football	team	that	never	fucking	wins	.
--------------------
About	human	relationships	and	all	the	things	that	really	don	't	matter	...	when	you	've	got	a	sincere	and	truthful	junk	habit	.
I	'd	say	,	in	those	days	,	he	was	a	muscular	actor	.
With	all	the	presence	of	someone	like	Cooper	or	Lancaster	...	but	combined	with	a	sly	wit	...	-	to	make	him	a	formidable	romantic	lead	.
And	closer	,	in	that	respect	,	to	Cary	Grant	.
Ahh	.
Hey	,	man	,	where	'd	you	get	that	illusion
The	only	drawback	,	or	at	least	the	principal	drawback	...	is	that	you	have	to	endure	all	manner	of	cunts	telling	you	that
No	way	would	I	poison	my	body	with	that	shite	.
All	them	fucking	chemicals	.
No	fucking	way	.
--------------------
It	's	a	waste	of	your	life	,	man	...	poisoning	your	body	with	that	shite	.
Every	chance	you	've	had	,	son	,	you	've	blown	it	.
Stuffing	your	veins	with	that	filth	.
From	time	to	time	,	even	I	have	uttered	the	magic	words	.
Never	again	,	Swanney	.
I	'm	off	the	skag	.
Are	you	serious	?
Yeah	,	no	more	.
I	'm	finished	with	that	shite	.
Well	,	that	's	up	to	you	,	man	.
--------------------
Gonna	do	it	right	this	time	.
Gonna	get	it	sorted	out	,	get	off	it	for	good	.
I	'm	sure	I	've	heard	that	one	before	.
The	Sick	Boy	method	.
Oh	,	well	,	it	really	worked	for	him	,	eh	?
Well	,	he	's	always	been	lacking	in	moral	fiber	.
He	knows	a	lot	about	Sean	Connery	.
That	's	hardly	a	substitute	.
You	need	one	more	hit	?
No	,	I	don	't	think	so	.
--------------------
You	need	one	more	hit	?
No	,	I	don	't	think	so	.
For	the	long	night	that	lies	ahead	?
We	called	him	Mother	Superior	on	account	of	the	length	of	his	habit	.
Of	course	,	I	'd	have	another	shot	.
After	all	,	I	had	work	to	do	.
Relinquishing	junk	.
Stage	one	:	preparation	.
For	this	,	you	will	need	one	room	which	you	will	not	leave	.
Soothing	music	.
--------------------
Tomato	soup	,	ten	tins	of	.
Mushroom	soup	,	eight	tins	of	,	for	consumption	cold	.
Ice	cream	,	vanilla	,	one	large	tub	of	.
Magnesia	,	milk	of	,	one	bottle	.
Paracetamol	,	mouthwash	,	vitamins	.
Mineral	water	,	Lucozade	,	pornography	.
one	for	feces	and	one	for	vomitus	.
One	television	and	one	bottle	of	Valium	,	which	I	've	already	procured	from	my	mother	...	who	is	,	in	her	own	domestic	and	socially	acceptable	way	,	also	a	drug	addict	.
Now	I	'm	ready	.
All	I	need	is	one	final	hit	to	soothe	the	pain	...	while	the	Valium	takes	effect	.
--------------------
Mikey	?
Aye	,	yeah	,	it	's	Mark	Renton	.
Look	,	I	wondered	,	could	you	help	me	out	?
This	was	typical	of	Mikey	Forrester	.
What	the	fuck	are	these	?
Under	the	normal	run	of	things	...
I	would	have	nothing	to	do	with	the	cunt	,	but	this	was	not	the	normal	run	of	things	.
Opium	suppositories	.
Ideal	for	your	purposes	.
Slow	release	,	bring	you	down	gradually	.
--------------------
Custom-	fucking-	designed	for	your	needs	.
I	want	a	fucking	hit	.
That	's	all	I	've	got	,	man	.
Take	it	or	leave	it	.
Are	you	feeling	better	now	then	,	eh	?
Oh	,	aye	.
For	all	the	good	they	've	done	,	I	might	as	well	have	stuck	them	up	my	arse	.
Heroin	makes	you	constipated	.
The	heroin	from	my	last	hit	is	fading	away	and	the	suppositories	have	yet	to	melt	.
I	'm	no	longer	constipated	.
--------------------
I	fantasize	about	a	massive	pristine	convenience	.
Brilliant	gold	taps	,	virginal	white	marble	,	a	seat	carved	from	ebony	...	a	cistern	full	of	Chanel	No	.
5	and	a	flunky	...	handing	me	pieces	of	raw	silk	toilet	roll	.
But	under	the	circumstances	,	I	'll	settle	for	anywhere	.
Oh	,	fuck	.
Oh	,	my
Yes	,	a	fucking	dancer	!
Yes	,	a	fucking	dancer	!
The	downside	of	coming	off	junk	was	I	knew	I	would	need	to	mix	with	my	friends	again	...	in	a	state	of	full	consciousness	.
It	was	awful	.
--------------------
They	reminded	me	so	much	of	myself	I	could	hardly	bear	to	look	at	them	.
Take	Sick	Boy	,	for	instance	.
He	came	off	junk	at	the	same	time	as	me	.
Not	because	he	wanted	to	,	you	understand	,	but	just	to	annoy	me	.
Just	to	show	me	how	easily	he	could	do	it	.	Thereby	,	downgrading	my	own	struggle	.
Sneaky	fucker	,	don	't	you	think	?
And	when	all	I	wanted	to	do	was	lie	there	and	feel	sorry	for	myself	...	he	insisted	on	telling	me	once	again	about	his	unifying	theory	of	life	.
It	's	certainly	a	phenomenon	in	all	walks	of	life	.
What	do	you	mean	?
Well	,	at	one	point	,	you	've	got	it	,	then	you	lose	it	.
--------------------
And	it	's	gone	forever	.
All	walks	of	life	.
Georgie	Best	,	for	example	,	had	it	,	lost	it	.
Or	David	Bowie	or	Lou	Reed	.
Lou	Reed	.
Some	of	his	solo	stuff	's	not	bad	.
No	,	it	's	not	bad	,	but	it	's	not	great	either	,	is	it	?
And	in	your	heart	you	kind	of	know	that	although	it	sounds	all	right	...	it	's	actually	just	shite	.
So	,	who	else	?
Charlie	Nicholas	,	David	Niven	,	Malcolm	McLaren	,	Elvis	Presley	-	-	Okay	,	okay	,	okay	.
--------------------
So	what	is	the	point	you	're	trying	to	make	?
All	I	am	trying	to	do	,	Mark	...	is	to	help	you	understand	that	"	The	Name	of	the	Rose	"	is	merely	a	blip	...	on	an	otherwise	uninterrupted	downward	trajectory	.
What	about	"	The	Untouchables	"	?
I	don	't	rate	that	at	all	.
Despite	the	Academy	Award	?
That	means	fuck-	all	.
It	's	a	sympathy	vote	.
So	,	we	all	get	old	.
We	can	't	hack	it	anymore	and	that	's	it	?
Yeah	.
--------------------
That	's	your	theory	?
Yeah	.
Beautifully	fucking	illustrated	.
Give	me	the	gun	.
Give	me	the	gun	.
Do	you	see	the	beast	?
Have	you	got	it	in	your	sights	?
Clear	enough	,	Miss	Moneypenny	.
This	should	present	no	significant	problems	.
Fucking	hell	!
--------------------
Get	away
For	a	vegetarian	,	Rents	,	you	're	a	fuckin	'	evil	shot	.
Without	heroin	I	attempted	to	lead	a	useful	and	fulfilling	life	as	a	good	citizen	.
Good	luck	,	Spud	.
Cheers	,	cowboy	.
Now	remember	,	if	they	think	you	're	not	trying	,	you	're	in	trouble	,	right	?
First	hint	of	that	,	and	they	'll	be	onto	the	D.	H.	S.	S.	,	"	This	cunt	is	not	trying	.	"
And	your	giro	's	fuckin	'	finished	,	right	?
Right	.
But	,	then	again	,	try	too	hard
--------------------
You	might	get	the	fuckin	'	job	.
Exactly	.
Nightmare	.
It	's	a	tightrope	,	Spud	.
It	's	a	fuckin	'	tightrope	.
See	,	I	just	get	pure	shy	with	the	interviewer	cats	.
I	get	all	nervous	.
I	can	't	answer	any	of	their	questions	,	like	I	'm	a	footballer	...	and	I	get	nerves	on	the	big	occasion	,	man	.
Try	some	of	this	,	Spud	.
Yeah	,	a	little	dab	of	speed	is	just	the	ticket	,	mate	.
--------------------
No	,	I	went	to	Craignewton	.
I	just	put	down	Royal	Edinburgh	College	to	help	get	the	job	.
There	's	too	much	discrimination	in	this	town	,	man	.
They	're	both	schools	,	right	?
They	're	both	schools	,	right	?
We	're	all	in	this	together	.
And	I	wanted	to	put	across	the	general	idea	,	rather	than	the	details	.	tipo	,	que	escola	freqüentei	,	quantos	zeros	tirei	.
Like	people	get	all	hung	up	on	details	.
Mr.	Murphy	,	do	you	mean	that	you	lied	on	your	application	?
No	-	Well	,	yes	.
--------------------
Only	to	get	my	foot	in	the	door	.
Showing	initiative	and	that	like	.
But	you	were	referred	here	by	the	Department	of	Employment	.
There	was	no	need	for	you	to	get	your	"	foot	in	the	door	,	"	as	you	put	it	.
Yeah	,	cool	.
Whatever	you	say	.
Sorry	.
You	're	the	man	,	the	dude	in	the	chair	.
I	am	merely	here	-	Like	,	well	,	obviously	,	I	'm	here	like	,	but
Mr.	Murphy	,	what	exactly	attracts	you	to	the	leisure	industry	?
--------------------
In	a	word	,	pleasure	.
Like	,	my	pleasure	in	other	people	's	leisure	.
Do	you	see	yourself	as	having	any	weaknesses	?
Oh	,	yes	,	'cause	,	like	,	I	'm	a	bit	of	a	perfectionist	,	actually	!
Yes	,	I	am	.
See	,	for	me	,	it	's	got	to	be	the	best	,	or	it	's	nothing	at	all	.
Like	things	get	a	bit	dodgy	,	I	just	cannot	be	bothered	.
But	,	hey	,	I	'm	getting	good	vibes	about	this	interview	thing	today	,	though	,	man	.
Seems	to	me	like	it	's	going	pretty	well	,	eh	?
Thank	you	,	Mr.	Murphy	.
--------------------
We	'll	let	you	know	.
The	pleasure	was	mine	,	man	.
Spud	had	done	well	.
I	was	proud	of	him	.
Thanks	.
Ooh	,	sorry	.
He	fucked	up	good	and	proper	.
You	had	to	hand	it	to	Spud	.
Picture	the	scene	.
The	other	fuckin	'	week	there	...	doin	'	the	fuckin	'	Volley	with	Tommy	playing	pool	.
--------------------
I	'm	playin	'	like	Paul-	fuckin	'	-	Newman	by	the	way	...	givin	'	the	boy	here	the	tannin	'	of	a	lifetime	.
So	it	comes	to	the	last	shot	,	the	deciding	ball	of	the	whole	tournament	.
I	'm	in	the	black	,	and	he	's	sittin	'	in	the	corner	looking	all	fucking	biscuit-	arsed	.
When	this	hard	cunt	comes	in	.
Obviously	fucking	fancied	himself	like	.
Starts	staring	at	me	.
Looking	at	me	,	right	fucking	at	me	,	as	if	to	say	,	"	Come	ahead	,	square	go	.	"
Vocês	me	conhecem	.	You	know	me	.
I	'm	not	the	type	of	cunt	that	goes	looking	for	fucking	bother	...	but	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	I	'm	the	cunt	with	the	pool	cue	...	and	he	can	get	the	fat	end	in	his	puss	any	time	he	fucking	wanted	,	like	.
So	I	squares	up	,	casual	like	.
--------------------
What	does	the	hard	cunt	do	?
Or	the	so-	called	hard	cunt	?
Shites	it	.
Puts	down	his	drink	,	turns	and	gets	the	fuck	out	of	there	.
And	after	that	,	well	,	the	game	was	mine	.
And	that	was	it	.
That	was	Begbie	's	story	...	or	,	at	least	,	that	was	Begbie	's	version	of	the	story	.
But	a	couple	of	days	later	,	I	got	the	truth	from	Tommy	.
You	always	got	the	truth	from	Tommy	.
That	was	one	of	his	major	weaknesses	.
--------------------
He	never	told	lies	,	he	never	took	drugs	,	and	he	never	cheated	on	anyone	.
It	was	Wednesday	morning	.
We	were	in	the	Volley	playing	pool	.
That	much	is	true	.
But	Begbie	is	playing	absolutely	fucking	gash	.
He	's	got	a	hangover	so	bad	,	he	can	hardly	hold	the	fucking	cue	,	never	mind	pot	a	ball	.
I	'm	doing	my	best	to	lose	,	you	know	.
Trying	to	humor	him	,	like	,	but	it	's	not	doing	any	good	.
Every	time	I	touch	a	ball	,	I	seemed	to	pot	something	.
Every	time	Begbie	goes	near	the	table	,	he	fucks	it	up	.
--------------------
Oh	,	fuck	's	sake	.
So	,	he	's	got	the	hump	,	right	.
But	,	finally	,	I	managed	to	set	it	up	...	so	all	he	has	to	do	is	to	pot	the	black	to	win	one	game,	to	salvage	a	little	bit	of	pride	and	maybe	not	kick	my	head	in	,	right	.
So	,	he	's	on	the	black	.
Pressure	shot	.
And	it	all	goes	wrong	big	time	.
Fuck	!
He	picks	on	this	specky	,	wee	gadge	at	the	bar	and	accuses	him	of	putting	him	off	by	looking	at	him	.
Could	you	believe	it	?
The	poor	wee	cunt	hasn	't	even	glanced	in	our	direction	.
--------------------
Fuck	off	!
He	was	gonna	chib	him	,	I	tell	you	.
Then	I	thought	he	was	gonna	do	me	.
The	beggar	's	fucking	psycho	,	man	.
But	...	he	's	a	mate	.
So	what	can	you	do	?
Can	I	borrow	this	?
What	,	indeed	,	could	one	do	?
Just	stand	back	and	watch	and	try	not	to	get	involved	?
Begbie	didn	't	do	drugs	either	.
--------------------
He	just	did	people	.
That	's	what	he	got	off	on	.
His	own	sensory	addiction	.
Hey	!
Nobody	move	!
That	lassie	got	glassed	...	and	no	cunt	leaves	here	'	til	we	find	out	what	cunt	did	it	!
Who	the	fuck	are	you	?
Oh	,	Lizzy	,	you	've	been	so	good	to	me	.
Oh	,	Tommy	,	come	here	.
And	as	I	sat	watching	the	intimate	and	highly	personal	video	...	stolen	only	hours	earlier	from	one	of	my	best	friends	...
--------------------
I	realized	that	something	important	was	missing	from	my	life	.
Leave	no	track
Don	't	look	back
Only	desire	-	Temptation
We	're	climbing	higher	and	higher	-	Temptation
Adorable	creature	-	Temptation
You	've	got	acceptable	features	-	Temptation
Trouble	is	coming	-	Temptation
It	's	just	the	high	cost	of	loving	-	Temptation
You	can	take	it	or	leave	it	-	Temptation
--------------------
But	you	'd	better	believe	it
I	read	it	in	Cosmopolitan	.
It	's	an	interesting	theory	.
Actually	,	it	's	a	nightmare	.
I	've	been	desperate	for	a	shag	,	but	watching	him	suffer	is	just	too	much	fun	.
You	should	try	it	with	Tommy	.
What	?
And	deny	myself	the	only	pleasure	I	get	from	him	?
Did	I	tell	you	about	my	birthday	?
No	,	what	happened	?
--------------------
He	forgot	.
Useless	motherfucker	.
Leave	no	trace
Find	your	place
All	I	desire	-	Temptation
We	're	climbing	higher	and	higher	-	Temptation
You	can	take	it	or	leave	it	-	Temptation
But	you	'd	better	believe	it
What	are	you	two	talking	about	?
Football	.
--------------------
What	are	you	talking	about	?
Shopping	.
The	situation	was	becoming	serious	.
Young	Renton	noticed	the	haste	with	which	the	successful	in	the	sexual	sphere	as	in	all	others	,	segregated	themselves	from	the	failures	.
Heroin	had	robbed	Renton	of	his	sex	drive	...
Heroin	had	robbed	Renton	of	his	sex	drive	...
And	as	the	impotence	of	those	days	faded	into	memory	...	grim	desperation	took	ahold	in	his	sex-	crazed	mind	.
His	post-	junk	libido	,	fueled	by	alcohol	and	amphetamine	...	taunted	him	remorselessly	with	his	own	unsatisfied	desire	.
Dot	,	dot	,	dot	.
And	with	that	,	Mark	Renton	had	fallen	in	love	.
--------------------
Excuse	me	,	excuse	me	.
I	don	't	mean	to	harass	you	,	but	I	was	very	impressed	...	with	the	capable	and	stylish	manner	in	which	you	dealt	with	that	situation	.
I	was	thinking	to	myself	,	now	this	girl	's	special	.
Thanks	.
What	's	your	name	?
Diane	.
Where	are	you	going	,	Diane	?
I	'm	going	home	.
Where	's	that	?
It	's	where	I	live	.
--------------------
Great	.
What	?
I	'll	come	back	with	you	if	you	like	,	but	I	'm	not	promising	anything	.
Do	you	find	that	this	approach	usually	works	?
Or	,	let	me	guess	,	you	've	never	tried	it	before	.
In	fact	,	you	don	't	normally	approach	girls	.
Am	I	right	?
The	truth	is	that	you	're	a	quiet	,	sensitive	type	...	but	,	if	I	'm	prepared	to	take	a	chance	I	might	just	get	to	know	the	inner	you	:	witty	,	adventurous	,	passionate	,	loving	,	loyal
Taxi	!
A	little	bit	crazy	,	a	little	bit	bad	.
--------------------
But	,	hey	,	don	't	us	girls	just	love	that	?
Eh	?
Well	...	what	's	wrong	,	boy	?
Cat	got	your	tongue	?
I	left	something
You	getting	in	or	not	,	pal	?
Do	you	understand	?
I	expect	you	to	be	a	considerate	and	thoughtful	lover	.
Generous	but	firm	.
What	?
--------------------
Failure	on	your	part	to	live	up	to	these	very	reasonable	expectations	...	will	result	in	swift	resumption	of	a	non-	sex	situation	.
Right	?
Diane	.
Shh	.
What	?
Wake	up	,	Spud	.
Wake	up	.
Sex	.
Casual	sex	.
Tommy	,	let	's	put	the	tape	on	.
--------------------
Now	?
I	want	to	watch	ourselves	while	we	're	screwing	.
So	let	's	see	what	I	'm	missing	.
Not	much	.
And	there	's	the	captain	,
Archie	Gemmill	picking	it	up	from	the	outside	.
I	think	he	wants	to	go	himself	.
How	far	is	he	gonna	go	?
He	's	going	all	the	way	,	and	he	scores	!
Oh	,	what	a	magnificent	goal	!
--------------------
Gemmill	at	his	very	best	!
What	a	penetrating	goal	that	was	!
I	haven	't	felt	that	good	since	Archie	Gemmill	scored	against	Holland	in	1978	.
Renton	...	you	can	't	sleep	here	.
What	?
Out	.
Come	on	.
No	argument	.
You	can	sleep	on	the	sofa	in	the	hall	or	go	home	.
It	's	up	to	you	.
--------------------
And	don	't	make	any	noise	.
Jesus	.
What	do	you	mean	,	it	's	gone	?
Where	has	it	gone	,	Tommy	?
It	'll	be	here	somewhere	!
I	might	have	returned	it	by	mistake	.
"	Returned	it	"	?
Where	?
The	video	shop	,	Tommy	?
The	fucking	video	shop	?
--------------------
So	every	punter	in	Edinburgh	is	jerking	off	to	our	video	?
Oh	,	God	,	Tommy	,	I	feel	sick	!
Hi	.
Hello	.
Come	in	and	sit	down	.
Like	some	coffee	?
Aye	.
You	must	be	Mark	.
Aye	,	that	's	me	.
You	're	a	friend	of	Diane	's	?
--------------------
More	a	friend	of	a	friend	,	no	?
Right	.
Are	you	her	flatmates	?
"	Flatmates	"	?
I	must	remember	that	one	.
'Morning	.
Good	morning	,	Spud	.
'Morning	,	Gail	.
Mr.	Houston	.
Mrs.	Houston	.
--------------------
'Morning	,	Spud	.
Sit	down	and	have	some	breakfast	.
Sorry	about	last	night	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	all	right	.
I	slept	fine	on	the	sofa	.
I	had	a	bit	much	to	drink	.
I	had	a	bit	of	an	accident	.
Don	't	worry	,	son	.
These	things	happen	.
Does	a	man	good	to	cut	loose	once	in	awhile	.
--------------------
Only	this	one	could	do	with	being	tied	up	once	in	a	while	.
I	'll	put	the	sheets	in	the	machine	.
No	,	no	,	no	.
I	'll-	I	'll	wash	them	.
There	's	no	need	.
No	,	it	's	no	problem	.
It	's	no	problem	for	me	either	.
I	'd	rather	take	care	of	it	myself	.
Honestly	,	it	's	no	problem	.
Really	,	no	!
--------------------
Spud	,	they	're	my	sheets	!
I	don	't	see	why	not	.
Because	it	's	illegal	,	that	's	why	not	.
What	,	holding	hands	?
No	,	not	holding	hands	.
In	that	case	,	you	can	do	it	.
You	were	quite	happy	to	do	a	lot	more	last	night	.
Yeah	,	that	's	what	's	illegal	.
Do	you	know	what	they	do	to	people	like	me	inside	?
They	cut	your	balls	off	and	flush	'em	down	the	fucking	toilet	.
--------------------
Calm	down	.	You	're	not	going	to	jail	.
Oh	,	well	,	that	's	very	easy	for	you	to	say	,	Diane	.
Can	I	see	you	again	?
Certainly	not	.
If	you	don	't	see	me	again	,	I	'll	tell	the	police	.
I	'll	see	you	around	then	.
Now	what	?
We	go	for	a	walk	.
What	?
A	walk	.
--------------------
Where	?
There	.
Are	you	serious	?
Well	,	what	are	you	waiting	for	?
Hey	,	Tommy	...	this	is	not	natural	,	man	.
It	's	the	great	outdoors	!
It	's	fresh	air	!
Look	,	Tommy	,	we	know	you	're	getting	a	hard	time	off	Lizzy	...	but	there	's	really	no	need	to	take	it	out	on	us	.
Doesn	't	it	make	you	proud	to	be	Scottish	?
It	's	shite	being	Scottish	!
--------------------
We	're	the	lowest	of	the	low	!
The	scum	of	the	fucking	Earth	!
The	most	wretched	,	miserable	,	servile	,	pathetic	trash	...	that	was	ever	shat	into	civilization	!
Some	people	hate	English	.
I	don	't	!
They	're	just	wankers	!
We	,	on	the	other	hand	,	are	colonized	by	wankers	!
Can	't	even	find	a	decent	culture	to	be	colonized	by	!
We	're	ruled	by	effete	arseholes	!
It	's	a	shite	state	of	affairs	to	be	in	,	Tommy	!
--------------------
And	all	the	fresh	air	in	the	world	won	't	make	any	fucking	difference	!
Sorry	,	man	.
Sorry	.
No	,	I	'm	sorry	.
Look	,	I	appreciate	it	,	Tommy
At	or	around	this	time	,	Spud	,	Sick	Boy	and	I	...	made	a	healthy,	informed,	democratic	decision	to	get	back	on	heroin	as	soon	as	possible	.
It	took	about	12	hours	.
It	looks	easy	this	,	but	it	's	not	.
It	looks	like	a	doss	,	like	a	soft	option	.
But	living	like	this	is	a	full-	time	business	.
--------------------
Ursula	Andress	,	the	quintessential	Bond	girl	.
That	's	what	everyone	says	.
The	embodiment	,	right	,	of	his	superiority	to	us	.
Beautiful	,	exotic	,	highly	sexual	.
Yet	totally	unavailable	to	anyone	apart	from	him	.
Shite	.
I	mean	,	let	's	face	it	,	mate	.
She	'd	shag	one	punter	from	Edinburgh	,	she	'd	shag	the	whole	fucking	lot	of	us	.
Nightclubbing	we	're	nightclubbing
Well	done	.
--------------------
Yep	,	I	knew	he	was	gonna	do	that	.
Lizzy	's	gone	,	Mark	.
She	's	gone	and	fucking	dumped	me	.
It	was	that	videotape	...	and	that	lggy	Pop	business	and	all	other	sorts	of	shite	.
She	told	me	where	to	go	and	no	fucking	mistake	.
I	said	to	her	,	I	said	,	"	Look	,	is	there	any	chance	of	getting	back	together	?	"
No	way	.
No	fucking	way	.
Honor	Blackman	...	a	.	k	.	a	.
Pussy	Galore	,	right	?
--------------------
What	a	total	fucking	misnomer	.
I	mean	I	would	not	touch	her	with	yours	.
I	want	to	try	it	,	Mark	.
You	're	always	going	on	about	how	it	's	the	ultimate	hit	and	that	.
Better	than	sex	.
Come	on	,	man	,	I	'm	a	fucking	adult	.
I	can	find	out	for	myself	.
I	've	got	the	money	.
Personality	.
I	mean	,	that	's	what	counts	,	right	?
--------------------
Personality	.
I	mean	that	's	what	keeps	a	relationship	going	through	the	years	.
Like	heroin	.
I	mean	...
Heroin	's	got	great	fucking	personality	.
Swanney	taught	us	to	adore	and	respect	the	National	Health	Service	...	for	it	was	the	source	of	much	of	our	gear	.
We	stole	drugs	.
We	stole	prescriptions	or	bought	them	...	sold	them	,	swapped	them	,	forged	them	,	photocopied	them	.
Or	traded	drugs	with	cancer	victims	...	alcoholics	,	pensioners	,	AlDS	patients	,	epileptics	and	bored	housewives	.
We	took	morphine	,	diamorphine	,	cyclozine	,	codeine	,	temazepam	...	nitrazepam	,	phenobarbitone	,	and	sodium	amytal	...	dextropropoxyphene	,	methadone	,	nalbuphine	,	pethidine	,	pentazocine	...	buprenorphine	,	dextromoramide	,	chlormethiazole	.
--------------------
The	streets	are	awash	with	drugs	you	can	have	...	for	unhappiness	and	pain	,	and	we	took	them	all	.
Fuck	it	,	we	would	've	injected	vitamin	C	if	only	they	'd	made	it	illegal	.
Pardon	me	,	may	I	use	your	bathroom	?
Thank	you	.
You	're	a	psycho	!
Hey	,	Rent	boy	...	no	fucking	smack	.
But	the	good	times	couldn	't	last	forever	.
I	think	Allison	had	been	screaming	all	day	...
but	it	hadn	't	really	registered	before	.
She	might	have	been	screaming	for	a	week	for	all	I	knew	.	had	been	days	since	I	'd	heard	anyone	speak	.
--------------------
Help	me	!
Though	surely	someone	must	have	said	something	in	all	that	time	.
Help	me	,	please	!
Hey	,	calm	down	!
Everything	'll	be	just	fine	.
Nothing	could	have	been	further	from	the	truth	.
In	point	of	fact	,	nothing	was	gonna	be	just	fine	.
On	the	contrary	,	everything	was	gonna	be	bad	.
Bad	.
I	mean	,	everything	was	gonna	be	even	worse	than	it	already	was	.
--------------------
Fuck	.
It	wasn	't	my	baby	.
She	wasn	't	my	baby	.
Baby	Dawn	,	she	wasn	't	mine	.
Spud	's	,	Swanney	's	...
Sick	Boy	's	?
I	don	't	know	.
Maybe	Allison	knew	,	maybe	not	.
I	wished	I	could	think	of	something	to	say	.
Something	sympathetic	,	something	human	.
--------------------
Say	something	,	Mark	.
Fucking	say	something	,	huh	?
I	'm	cooking	up	.
Cook	us	up	a	shot	,	Rent	.
I	really	need	a	hit	.
And	so	she	did	.
I	could	understand	that	.
To	take	the	pain	away	.
So	I	cooked	up	,	and	she	got	a	hit	.
But	only	after	me	.
--------------------
That	went	without	saying	.
Well	,	at	least	we	knew	who	the	father	was	now	.
It	wasn	't	just	the	baby	that	died	that	day	.
Something	inside	Sick	Boy	was	lost	and	never	returned	.
It	seemed	he	had	no	theory	with	which	to	explain	a	moment	like	this	,	nor	did	l	.
Our	only	response	was	to	keep	on	going	and	fuck	everything	.
Pile	misery	upon	misery	.
Heap	it	up	on	a	spoon	and	dissolve	it	with	a	drop	of	bile	.
Then	squirt	it	into	a	stinking	,	purulent	vein	and	do	it	all	over	again	.
Keep	on	going	,	getting	up	,	going	out	,	robbing	,	stealing	,	fucking	people	over	.
--------------------
Propelling	ourselves	with	longing	towards	the	day	it	would	all	go	wrong	.
Because	no	matter	how	much	you	stash	or	how	much	you	steal	,	you	never	have	enough	.
No	matter	how	often	you	go	out	and	rob	and	fuck	people	over	...	you	always	need	to	get	up	and	do	it	all	over	again	.
Gangway	!
Sooner	or	later	,	this	kind	of	thing	was	bound	to	happen	.
Because	shoplifting	is	theft	,	which	is	a	crime	...	and	,	despite	what	you	may	believe	,	there	is	no	such	entity	as	victimless	crime	.
Heroin	addiction	may	explain	your	actions	,	but	it	does	not	excuse	them	.
Mr.	Murphy	,	you	are	a	habitual	thief	devoid	of	regret	and	remorse	.
In	sentencing	you	to	six	months	imprisonment	,	my	only	worry	is	...	that	it	will	not	be	long	before	we	meet	again	.
Mr.	Renton	,	I	understand	that	you	have	entered	into	a	program	...	of	rehabilitation	in	an	attempt	to	wean	yourself	away	from	heroin	.
--------------------
The	suspension	of	your	sentence	...	is	conditional	on	your	continued	cooperation	with	this	program	.
Should	you	stand	guilty	before	me	again	,	I	shall	not	hesitate	...	to	impose	a	custodial	sentence	.
Thank	you	,	Your	Honor	.
With	God	's	help	,	I	'll	conquer	this	terrible	affliction	.
What	can	you	say	?
Well	,	Begbie	had	a	phrase	for	it	.
It	was	fucking	obvious	that	that	cunt	was	going	to	fuck	some	cunt	.
Well	,	I	hope	you	learned	your	lesson	,	son	.
Oh	,	my	son	.
I	thought	I	was	gonna	lose	you	there	.
--------------------
You	're	nothin	'	but	trouble	to	me	,	but	I	still	love	you	.
You	'd	better	clean	up	your	fucking	act	,	sunshine	.
Cut	that	shite	out	forever	.
You	listen	to	Francis	,	Mark	.
He	's	talking	sense	,	kid	.
You	're	fucking	right	I	am	.
See	,	inside	,	you	wouldn	't	last	two	fucking	days	.
There	's	better	things	than	the	needle	,	Rents	.
Choose	life	.
I	remember	when	you	were	a	wee	baby	.
--------------------
Oh	,	mama	's	little	baby
loves	shortening	,	shortening	Mama	's	little	baby	loves	shortening	bread
I	'm	sorry	,	Mrs.	Murphy	.
It	wasn	't	fair	,	Spud	going	down	and	not	me	.
Well	,	it	's	not	our	fault	!
Your	boy	went	down	because	he	was	a	fucking	smack-	head	!
If	that	's	not	your	fault	,	then	I	don	't	know	what	is	!
I	was	the	fucking	cunt	that	tried	to	get	him	off	it	.
I	wished	I	'd	gone	down	instead	of	Spud	.
Here	I	was	surrounded	by	my	family	and	my	so-	called	mates	...	and	I	've	never	felt	so	alone	.
--------------------
Never	in	all	my	puff	.
Since	I	was	on	remand	,	they	've	had	me	on	this	program	.
The	state-	sponsored	addiction	.
Three	sickly	sweet	doses	of	methadone	a	day	instead	of	smack	.
But	it	's	never	enough	.
And	,	at	the	moment	,	it	's	nowhere	near	enough	.
I	took	all	three	this	morning	and	now	I	've	got	18	hours	to	go	'til	my	next	shot	...	and	the	sweat	on	my	back	like	a	layer	of	frost	.
I	need	to	visit	the	Mother	Superior	,	for	one	hit	.
One	fucking	hit	...	to	get	us	over	this	long	,	hard	day	.
What	's	on	the	menu	this	evening	,	sir	?
--------------------
Your	favorite	dish	.
Excellent	.
Usual	table	,	sir	?
Why	,	thank	you	.
Would	sir	care	to	pay	for	his	bill	in	advance	?
No	,	stick	it	on	my	tab	.
Ah	,	regret	to	inform	,	sir	,	credit	limit	was	reached	and	breached	some	time	ago	.
Oh	,	well	,	in	that	case
Ah	,	hard	currency	.
That	'll	do	nicely	.
--------------------
Can	't	be	too	careful	...	when	we	're	dealing	with	your	type	,	can	we	,	sir	?
Would	sir	care	for	a	starter	?
Some	garlic	bread	,	perhaps	?
No	,	thank	you	.
I	'll	proceed	directly	to	the	intravenous	injection	...
of	hard	drugs	,	please	.
As	you	wish	,	sir	.
As	you	wish	.
Perhaps	sir	would	like	me	to	call	for	a	taxi	?
Open	your	eyes	!
--------------------
Come	on	,	wake	up	!
I	don	't	feel	the	sickness	yet	,	but	it	's	in	the	mail	,	that	's	for	sure	.
I	'm	in	the	junkie	limbo	at	the	moment	.
Too	ill	to	sleep	,	too	tired	to	stay	awake	.
But	the	sickness	is	on	its	way	.
Sweat	,	chills	,	nausea	,	pain	and	craving	.
Need	,	like	nothing	else	I	've	ever	known	,	will	soon	take	hold	of	me	.
It	's	on	its	way	.
You	've	got	green	eyes	Ooh	,	you	've	got	blue	eyes
Ooh	,	you	've	got	gray	eyes
--------------------
And	I	've	never	seen	anyone	quite	like	you
Before
No	,	I	never	met	anyone	quite	like	you	before
We	'll	help	you	,	son	.
You	'll	stay	here	with	us	'	til	you	get	better	.
Gonna	beat	this	together	.
Maybe	I	-	Maybe	I	should	go	back	to	the	clinic	.
No	clinics	.
No	methadone	.
That	only	made	you	worse	.
--------------------
You	said	so	yourself	.
You	lied	to	us	,	son	.
Your	own	mother	...
and	father	.
You	could	bring	us	some	jellies	.
Nothing	at	all	!
It	's	a	clean	break	this	time	.
You	're	staying	here	where	we	can	keep	an	eye	on	you	.
I	appreciate	what	you	're	trying	to	do	,	I	really	do	,	but	I	just	need	one	more	score	.
Just	bring	me	one	more	hit	,	please	.
--------------------
I	need	one	more	fucking	hit	!
You	fuck	!
Bitch	!
Bitch	!
Well	...	this	is	a	good	fucking	laugh	,	isn	't	it	?
You	sweat	that	shite	out	of	your	system	..
'	Cause	if	I	come	back	and	it	's	still	here	...
I	'll	fucking	kick	it	out	.
Question	number	one	:
The	human	immunodeficiency	virus	is	a
--------------------
Retrovirus	.
Retrovirus	is	the	right	answer	!
It	's	a	mug	's	game	,	Mrs.	Renton	.
I	mean	,	I	'm	not	saying	I	was	blameless	myself	.
Far	from	it	.
But	there	comes	a	time	when	you	have	to	turn	your	back	on	all	that	nonsense	...
and	just	say	no	.
Oh	,	my	God	,	she	's	dead	!
Question	number	two	:
H.	I.	V.	binds	to	which	receptor	on	the	host	lymphocyte	?
--------------------
Which	receptor	is	that	?
CD4	.
CD-	4	is	the	right	answer	!
Better	than	sex	.
The	ultimate	hit	.
I	'm	a	fucking	adult	.
I	can	find	out	for	myself	.
Well	,	I	'm	finding	out	,	all	right	.
Tommy	.
No	.
--------------------
Stop	it	.
Dawn	,	stop	it	.
Is	he	guilty	or	not	guilty	?
He	's	our	son	.
No	!
Dawn	!
Dawn	!
There	's	something	you	need	to	do	.
Come	alive	,	35	.
Box	of	tricks	,	66	.
--------------------
Mark	.
Mark	,	you	get	the	house	!
House	!
House	!
For	goodness	sake	,	Mark	.
It	seems	,	however	,	I	am	the	luckiest	guy	in	the	world	.
Several	years	of	addiction	right	in	the	middle	of	an	epidemic	surrounded	by	the	living	dead	.
But	not	me	.
I	'm	negative	.
It	's	official	.
--------------------
And	once	the	pain	goes	away	,	that	's	when	the	real	battle	starts	:	depression	,	boredom	.
You	feel	so	fucking	low	,	you	want	to	fucking	top	yourself	.
Tommy	!
Tommy	!
Tommy	,	it	's	Mark	,	man	.
All	right	,	mate	?
Gettin	'	out	much	,	Tommy	?
No	.
Following	the	game	at	all	?
No	.
--------------------
Nah	,	me	neither	,	really	.
You	take	the	test	?
Clear	?
That	's	nice	.
I	'm	sorry	,	Tommy	.
Got	any	gear	on	you	?
No	,	I	'm	clean	,	man	.
Well	...	sub	us	then	,	mate	.
I	'm	expecting	a	rent	check	.
Thanks	,	Mark	.
--------------------
No	bother	.
No	bother	.
None	at	all	.
Not	for	me	,	anyway	.
Still	,	it	's	easy	to	be	philosophical	when	it	's	some	other	poor	cunt	with	shite	for	blood	.
What	do	you	want	?
Are	you	clean	?
Yes	.
Is	that	a	promise	then	?
Yes	,	it	is	,	as	a	matter	of	fact	.
--------------------
Calm	down	.
I	'm	only	asking	.
Is	that	hash	I	can	smell	?
No	.
I	wouldn	't	mind	a	bit	if	it	is	.
Well	,	it	isn	't	.
It	smells	like	it	.
You	're	too	young	.
I	'm	too	young	for	what	?
You	're	not	getting	any	younger	,	Mark	.
--------------------
The	world	's	changing	.
Music	's	changing	.
Even	drugs	are	changing	.
You	can	't	stay	in	here	all	day	dreaming	about	heroin	and	Ziggy	Pop	.
It	's	lggy	Pop	.
Whatever	.	I	mean	,	the	guy	's	dead	anyway	.
Iggy	Pop	is	not	dead	.
He	toured	last	year	.
Tommy	went	to	see	him	.
The	point	is	,	you	've	got	to	find	something	new	.
--------------------
She	was	right	.
I	had	to	find	something	new	.
Lifestyle	Letting	Agency	.
Oh	,	yes	,	it	's	a	beautifully	converted	Victorian	town	house	.
Ideally	located	on	a	quiet	road	near	to	the	local	shops	and	transport	.
Um	,	this	one	's	two	bedrooms	and	a	kitchen/	diner	.
Fully	fitted	,	in	excellent	decorative	order	.
Lots	of	storage	space	and	all	mod	cons	.
It	's	going	at	£320	a	week	.
I	settled	in	not	too	badly	and	kept	myself	to	myself	.
--------------------
Sometimes	,	of	course	,	I	thought	about	the	guys	,	but	mainly	I	didn	't	miss	them	at	all	.
After	all	,	this	was	boomtown	,	where	any	fool	could	make	cash	from	chaos	,	and	plenty	did	.
Tell	you	what	I	've	got	.
I	've	got	a	beautifully	converted	Victorian	town	house	.
I	quite	enjoyed	the	sound	of	it	all	:	profit	,	loss	,	margins	...	takeovers	,	lending	,	letting	,	subletting	,	subdividing	...	cheating	,	scamming	,	fragmenting	,	breaking	away	.
Who	's	got	the	keys	to	Telegraph	Road	?
There	was	no	such	thing	as	society,	and	even	if	there	was	I	most	certainly	had	nothing	to	do	with	it	.
For	the	first	time	in	my	adult	life	,	I	was	almost	content	.
Dear	Mark	,	I	'm	glad	you	found	a	job	and	somewhere	to	live	.
School	is	fine	at	the	moment	.
--------------------
I	'm	not	pregnant	,	but	thanks	for	asking	.
Your	friend	,	Sick	Boy	,	asked	me	last	week	if	I	would	like	to	work	for	him	but	I	told	him	where	to	go	.
I	met	Spud	,	who	sends	his	regards	.
Or	at	least	I	think	that	's	what	he	said	.
No	one	has	seen	Tommy	for	ages	.
And	,	finally	,	Francis	Begbie	has	been	on	television	a	lot	this	week	...	as	he	is	wanted	by	the	police	in	connection	with	an	armed	robbery	in	a	jeweler	's	in	Corstorphine	.
Take	care	.	Yours	with	love	,	Diane	.
Francis	Begbie	.
Armed	robbery	?
What	,	with	a	replica	?
--------------------
How	the	fuck	can	it	be	armed	robbery	with	a	fucking	replica	?
Fucking	scandal	.
The	gear	.
Look	.
Supposed	to	be	fucking	solid	silver	.
It	's	fucking	garbage	.
Those	young	couples	investin	'	all	their	fucking	hopes	in	that	stuff	and	all	.
It	's	a	scandal	,	Franco	.
Too	fucking	right	it	is	.
How	about	the	wee	pot	noodles	by	the	way	?
--------------------
I	'm	fucking	Lee	Marvin	.
Begbie	settled	in	in	no	time	at	all	.
Fucking	find	cigarettes	.
Aye	.
Yes	,	it	's	my	house
Yeah	,	the	guy	's	a	psycho	.
But	it	's	true	.
He	's	a	mate	also	.
What	can	I	do	?
Hey	,	pop	down	to	bookie	's	and	put	a	line	on	for	us	.
--------------------
Can	you	not	go	yourself	?
I	'm	serious	here	.
I	'm	a	fugitive	from	the	law	,	and	I	can	't	even	walk	the	fuckin	'	streets	.
You	go	.
Doncaster	.
Four-	forty	.
Five	pound	to	win	.
Come	on	,	Bad	Boy	.
Bad	Boy	!
Came	in	at	16	to	1	.
--------------------
And	with	the	winnings	,	we	went	out	to	celebrate	.
Diane	was	right	.
The	world	is	changing	.
Music	is	changing	.
Drugs	are	changing	.
Even	men	and	women	are	changing	.
One	thousand	years	from	now	,	there	'll	be	no	guys	and	no	girls	,	just	wankers	.
Sounds	great	to	me	.
It	's	just	a	pity	no	one	told	Begbie	.
Fuck	!
--------------------
Fuck	!
lf	you	ask	me	,	we	're	heterosexual	by	default	not	by	decision	.
It	's	just	a	question	of	who	you	fancy	.
It	's	all	about	aesthetics	.
And	it	's	fuck-	all	to	do	with	morality	.
Fuck	!
But	you	try	telling	Begbie	that	.
Look	,	I	'm	not	a	fucking	buftie	,	and	that	's	the	end	of	it	.
Let	's	face	it	,	it	could	have	been	wonderful	.
Fucking	listen	to	me	,	you	piece	of	junkie	shit	.
--------------------
A	joke	's	a	fucking	joke	.
You	mention	that	again	,	and	I	'll	cut	you	up	.
You	understand	?
Since	I	last	saw	him	...
Sick	Boy	had	reinvented	himself	as	a	pimp	and	a	pusher	...	and	was	here	,	he	said	,	to	mix	business	and	pleasure	...	setting	up	contacts	,	as	he	constantly	informed	me	...	for	the	great	smack	deal	that	was	one	day	going	to	make	him	rich	.
Good	chips	.
I	can	't	believe	you	did	that	.
I	got	a	good	price	for	it	.
Rents	,	I	need	the	money	.
It	was	my	fucking	telly	!
--------------------
Christ	,	if	I	'd	known	you	were	gonna	get	so	humpty	about	it	...
I	wouldn	't	have	bothered	.
Fucking	rented	anyway	.
Are	you	gonna	eat	that	?
Have	you	got	a	passport	?
Why	?
I	met	this	bloke	.
Runs	a	hotel	,	brothel	.
Loads	of	contacts	.
Does	a	nice	sideline	in	punting	British	passports	to	foreigners	.
--------------------
Get	you	a	good	price	.
And	why	would	I	want	to	sell	my	passport	?
It	was	just	an	idea	.
I	had	to	get	rid	of	them	.
Sick	Boy	didn	't	do	his	drug	deal	,	and	he	didn	't	get	rich	.
Instead	,	he	and	Begbie	just	hung	around	my	bedsit	looking	for	things	to	steal	.
I	decided	to	offer	them	one	of	London	's	most	desirable	properties	.
But	,	of	course	,	they	weren	't	paying	any	rent	.
So	when	my	boss	found	two	desperate	suckers	who	would	...
Sick	Boy	and	Begbie	were	bound	to	feel	threatened	.
--------------------
Yep	,	lots	of	storage	.
All	mod	cons	,	320	quid	a	week	.
And	that	was	that	.
But	by	then	we	had	another	reason	to	go	back	:
Tommy	.
Tommy	knew	he	'd	got	the	virus	,	but	he	never	knew	he	's	gone	full	blown	.
What	was	it	,	pneumonia	or	cancer	?
No	,	toxoplasmosis	.
It	's	like	a	stroke	.
How	's	that	?
--------------------
He	wanted	to	see	Lizzy	again	.
She	wouldn	't	even	let	him	near	the	house	.
So	he	bought	her	a	present	.
He	brought	her	this	kitten	.
But	Lizzy	told	him	where	to	fucking	stick	it	.
Exactly	.
"	I	'm	not	wantin	'	that	cat	,	"	she	says	.
"	Get	the	fuck	,	right	.	"
So	there	's	Tommy	stuck	with	this	kitten	.
You	can	imagine	what	happened	.
--------------------
To	those	of	us	gathered	here	today	...
Thomas	McKenzie	filled	a	number	of	different	roles	in	our	lives	.
Thomas	was	a	son	,	a	brother	and	a	friend	.
The	thing	was	neglected	pissing	and	shitting	all	over	the	place	.
Tommy	's	lying	about	fucked	out	of	his	eyeballs	on	smack	or	downers	.
He	never	knew	you	could	get	toxoplasmosis	from	cat	shit	.
A	loving	man	who	had	a	great	lust	for	life	.
Neither	did	l	.
What	is	it	?
Fucking	horrible	.
--------------------
It	's	like	an	abscess	on	your	brain	.
Fucking	hell	.
Then	what	happened	?
He	starts	getting	these	headaches	...
so	he	just	uses	more	smack	,	you	know	,	for	the	pain	.
And	then	he	has	a	stroke	.
A	fucking	stroke	,	just	like	that	.
Gets	home	from	the	hospital	and	dies	three	weeks	later	.
He	'd	been	dead	for	ages	before	the	neighbors	...	complained	about	the	smell	and	got	the	police	to	break	down	the	door	.
Tommy	was	lying	facedown	in	a	pool	of	vomit	.
--------------------
He	has	gone	from	us	,	but	we	have	many	things	to	remember	him	by	.
The	kitten	was	fine	.
Would	you	all	please	rise	now	for	the	committal	?
Acha	que	eu	te	deixaria	chorando
When	there	's	room	on	my	horse	for	two
Climb	up	here	,	Tommy	Don	't	be	dying
I	can	go	just	as	fast	with	two
When	we	grow	up	we	'll	both	be	soldiers
And	our	horses	will	not	be	toys
And	I	wonder	if	we	'll	remember
--------------------
When	we	were	two	little	boys
Tommy	.
Tommy	.
Did	you	tell	him	yet	?
On	you	go	.
What	?
There	's	this	mate	of	Swanney	's	.
You	know	the	guy	.
Mikey	Forrester	.
Well	...	he	's	come	into	some	gear	.
--------------------
A	lot	of	gear	.
How	much	gear	?
About	two	kilos	.
So	he	tells	me	.
He	got	drunk	in	a	pub	down	by	the	docks	last	week	...	where	he	met	two	Russian	sailors	.
They	're	fucking	carrying	the	stuff	.
For	sale	there	and	then	,	like	.
So	he	wakes	up	next	morning	...	realizes	what	he	's	done	,	gets	very	fucking	nervous	.
He	wants	rid	of	this	,	right	?
So	?
--------------------
So	he	met	me	.
And	I	offered	to	take	it	off	his	hands	at	a	very	reasonable	price	...	with	the	intention	of	punting	it	on	myself	to	a	guy	I	know	in	London	.
We	've	just	come	back	from	Tommy	's	funeral	and	you	're	talking	about	a	skag	deal	?
What	was	your	price	?
Four	grand	.
You	haven	't	got	four	grand	.
We	're	2,	000	short	.
Well	,	that	's	tough	.
Look	,	Mark	,	every	cunt	knows	you	've	been	saving	up	in	London	.
I	'm	sorry	,	boys	.
--------------------
I	do	not	have	two	grand	.
Aye	,	you	fucking	do	.
I	've	seen	your	bank	statement	.
For	fuck	's	sake	.
Two	thousand	...	one	hundred	and	thirty-	three	pound	.
Two	kilos	.
What	is	that	,	ten	years	?
Mikey	Forrester	.
Russian	sailors	.
What	the	fuck	are	you	boys	on	?
--------------------
Eh	?
Spud	,	you	've	already	been	to	jail	.
What	's	the	deal	?
You	like	it	so	much	you	want	to	go	back	?
I	just	want	the	money	,	Mark	.
If	everybody	keeps	their	fucking	mouth	shut	,	there	'll	be	no	cunt	going	to	jail	.
I	hadn	't	told	anyone	everything	that	was	running	through	my	mind	about	what	might	happen	in	London	.
There	were	a	lot	of	possibilities	I	didn	't	want	to	talk	to	anyone	about	.
Ideas	best	kept	to	myself	.
What	no	one	told	me	was	that	when	we	bought	the	smack	...
--------------------
some	lucky	punter	would	have	to	try	it	out	.
Begbie	didn	't	trust	Spud	.
So	I	rolled	up	my	sleeve	,	I	spiked	my	vein	...	and	I	did	what	had	to	be	done	.
It	's	good	.
Oh	,	it	's	really	fucking	good	.
Yeah	,	that	hit	was	good	.
I	promised	myself	another	one	before	we	got	to	London	.
Just	the	one	hit	.
Just	for	old	time	's	sake	.
Just	to	piss	Begbie	off	.
--------------------
This	was	his	nightmare	.
The	dodgiest	scam	in	a	lifetime	of	dodgy	scams	.
Being	perpetrated	with	three	of	the	most	useless	and	unreliable	fuckups	in	town	.
I	knew	what	was	going	on	in	his	mind	.
Any	trouble	in	London	,	and	he	would	dump	us	immediately	.
One	way	or	another	,	he	had	to	.
If	he	got	caught	with	a	bag	full	of	smack	...	on	top	of	that	armed	robbery	shit	,	he	was	going	down	for	15	to	20	.
Begbie	was	hard	,	but	not	so	hard	that	he	didn	't	shite	it	off	20	years	in	prison	.
This	was	to	be	my	final	hit	.
But	let	's	be	clear	about	this	.
--------------------
There	's	final	hits	and	final	hits	.
What	kind	was	this	to	be	?
Did	you	bring	the	cards	?
What	?
The	cards	.
The	last	thing	I	told	you	was	to	mind	the	cards	.
Well	,	I	've	not	brought	them	.
Fucking	boring	after	a	while	without	the	cards	.
I	'm	sorry	.
But	fucking	late	,	like	.
--------------------
Why	didn	't	you	bring	them	?
'	Cause	I	fucking	told	you	to	bring	them	,	you	doss	cunt	!
Christ	.
These	are	your	friends	,	right	?
These	are	the	guys	I	told	you	about	.
Well	,	is	he	here	?
Yeah	,	he	's	here	.
You	didn	't	get	followed	or	nothing	,	did	you	?
Didn	't	get	followed	.
Okay	.
--------------------
Straight	away	he	clocked	us	for	what	we	were	:	small-	time	wasters	with	an	accidental	big	deal	.
Excuse	me	,	gentlemen	.
So	...	how	much	would	you	like	for	this	?
Twenty	thousand	.
Well	,	I	don	't	think	it	's	worth	much	more	than	15	.
This	was	a	real	drag	to	him	.
He	didn	't	need	to	negotiate	.
I	mean	,	what	the	fuck	were	we	going	to	do	with	it	if	he	didn	't	buy	it	?
Sell	it	on	the	streets	?
Fuck	that	.
--------------------
Well	,	19	.
Terribly	sorry	.
I	can	't	go	to	19	.
Well	,	fucking	16	then	.
Okay	.
"	Well	,	fucking	16	"	it	is	then	.
These	,	gentlemen	,	are	£2,	000	bundles	.
That	's	two	.
That	's	four	.
We	settled	on	£16,	000	.
--------------------
Now	you	have	six	.
He	had	a	lot	more	in	the	suitcase	,	like	,	but	it	was	better	than	nothing	.
And	two	more	make	eight	.
Thank	you	very	much	,	gentlemen	.
I	'd	just	like	to	say	,	it	's	been	a	pleasure	haggling	with	you	.
Fucking	better	be	.
And	just	for	a	moment	,	it	felt	really	great	.
Like	we	were	all	in	it	together	,	like	friends	.
Like	it	meant	something	.
A	moment	like	that	can	touch	you	deep	inside	.
--------------------
But	it	doesn	't	last	long	.
Not	like	£16,	000	.
So	what	about	you	,	Spud	?
Any	major	investments	on	the	horizon	at	all	?
Gonna	buy	yourself	a	wee	island	in	the	sun	?
For	four	grand	?
One	palm	tree	,	a	couple	of	rocks	and	a	fucking	sewage	outflow	.
I	don	't	know	,	man	.
I	'm	gonna	get	something	for	my	ma	,	I	think	.
Get	some	good	speed	.
--------------------
No	bicarb	.
Then	get	a	girl	,	take	her	out	,	treat	her	right	.
And	shag	her	senseless	.
No	,	man	!
True	love	.
True	love	.
Eh	,	but	I	could	really	handle	some	hot	sex	...
with	a	Jewish	princess	!
You	daft	cunt	!
Or	a	Catholic	!
--------------------
If	you	're	gonna	waste	it	on	a	bird	...
Get	our	drinks	.
I	got	a	round	already	.
Right	.
I	'm	off	for	a	piss	.
See	when	I	get	back	the	money	's	still	here	,	okay	?
The	moment	your	back	's	turned	,	we	're	out	the	door	.
Yeah	,	I	'll	be	right	fucking	after	you	.
You	'll	never	catch	us	,	you	flabby	bastard	.
By	the	way	,	see	you	when	I	get	back	.
--------------------
Be	halfway	down	the	street	with	the	money	.
I	'd	fucking	kill	you	.
Aye	,	I	thought	you	might	,	Franco	.
Thought	you	might	.
Are	you	game	for	it	?
What	?
Well	?
Are	you	serious	?
Don	't	know	.
Don	't	know	.
--------------------
What	do	you	think	?
Still	here	,	I	see	.
Aye	.
Well	,	we	wouldn	't	run	out	on	a	mate	,	eh	?
Why	not	?
I	know	I	would	.
Where	's	Franco	?
For	fuck	's	sake	!
Sorry	,	mate	.
I	'll	buy	you	another	one	.
--------------------
You	've	ruined	my	fucking	suit	,	you	fucking	idiot	!
Look	,	I	'm	sorry	.
I	didn	't	mean	it	.
Sorry	's	not	going	to	dry	me	off	,	you	cunt	.
Cool	down	,	Franco	.
The	man	says	he	's	sorry	.
He	's	sorry	enough	for	being	a	fat	cunt	.
Fuck	you	.
If	you	can	't	hold	a	pint	,	you	shouldn	't	be	in	the	pub	,	mate	.
Fuck	off	.
--------------------
Oh	,	no	!
No	,	Franco	,	don	't	do	it	,	man	.
For	fuck	's	sake	!
Fucking	nice	one	,	Franco	!
Shut	it	.
You	cut	me	,	man	!
You	were	in	my	fucking	way	.
You	cut	me	,	man	!
You	were	in	my	fucking	way	.
You	?
--------------------
You	?
Hey	,	Rent	boy	...	you	bring	me	down	a	fucking	smoke	.
I	think	we	'd	better	go	,	Franco	!
I	've	got	to	go	to	the	hospital	!
You	're	not	going	to	any	fucking	hospital	,	and	you	're	staying	there	!
You	bring	me	down	a	fucking	cigarette	.
And	the	bag	.
Now	I	've	justified	this	to	myself	in	all	sorts	of	ways	.
It	wasn	't	a	big	deal	,	just	a	minor	betrayal	.
Or	we	'd	outgrown	each	other	.
--------------------
You	know	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
But	let	's	face	it	.
I	ripped	them	off	.
My	so-	called	mates	.
But	Begbie	-	I	couldn	't	give	a	shit	about	him	.
And	Sick	Boy	.
He	'd	have	done	the	same	to	me	,	if	he	'd	only	thought	of	it	first	.
And	Spud	.
Well	,	okay	,	I	felt	sorry	for	Spud	.
He	never	hurt	anybody	.
--------------------
Bastard	!
Bastard	!
So	why	did	I	do	it	?
Open	up	.
Open	up	now	!
Bastard	!
Bastard	!
So	why	did	I	do	it	?
I	could	offer	a	million	answers	,	all	false	.
The	truth	is	that	I	'm	a	bad	person	.
--------------------
But	that	's	gonna	change	.
I	'm	going	to	change	.	This	is	the	last	of	that	sort	of	thing	.
Now	I	'm	cleaning	up	,	and	I	'm	moving	on	.
Going	straight	and	choosing	life	.
I	'm	looking	forward	to	it	already	.
I	'm	gonna	be	just	like	you	.
The	job	,	the	family	,	the	fucking	big	television	...	the	washing	machine	,	the	car	,	the	compact	disc	and	electrical	tin	opener	...	good	health	,	low	cholesterol	,	dental	insurance	...	mortgage	,	starter	home	,	leisure	wear	,	luggage	...	three-	piece	suite	,	D.	I.	Y.	,	game	shows	,	junk	food	,	children	...	walks	in	the	park	,	nine-	to-	five	,	good	at	golf	...	washing	the	car	,	choice	of	sweaters	,	family	Christmas	...	indexed	pension	,	tax	exemption	,	clearing	gutters	...
Oh	Romeo	..
Knock	knock	knock	ask	who	's	there
I	'm	Romeo	recognize	me	my	darling	?
--------------------
Knock	knock	knock	ask	who	's	there
I	'm	Romeo
I	have	the	world	at	my	feet
I	'm	everyone	's	envy
Seeing	me	they	burn	and	fry	go	on	,	ask	me	why	?

Has	it	already	begun	?
Please	,	hurry	up	.
--------------------
Loge	19	.
We	're	already	late	but	could	you	please	...
Fuhrer	is	there	.
I	can	't	do	anything	for	you	.
Wait	until	the	break	.
It	's	very	important	for	us	-	it	's	just	begun	.
The	music	is	so	loud	.
Please	make	an	exception	.
For	Fuhrer	.
For	the	officer	who	loves	Wagner	.
--------------------
But	be	quiet	.
And	stay	behind	the	curtain	.
Don	't	take	any	seats	until	the	break	.
He	's	sitting	over	there	.
He	's	watching	the	show	,	isn	't	he	?
He	looks	as	if	somebody	had	cast	an	incantation	over	him	.
He	loves	this	kind	of	music	.
And	he	loves	the	army	,	too	.
So	do	I.
Thanks	to	that	our	future	looks	very	bright	.
--------------------
Will	you	marry	me	?
What	?
Quiet	...
Will	you	marry	me	?
You	're	out	of	your	mind	!
Would	I	be	proposing	to	you	if	I	weren	't	?

Poland	,	September	1939
Dear	Nina	!
During	those	two	days	we	've	managed	to	reach	the	deep	inners	of	Poland	.
Desolated	land	,	lots	of	grass	and	dust	.
What	a	mixture	of	nationalities	:
Lots	of	Jews	and	other	mix-	ups	.
I	think	those	people	enjoy	being	oppressed	.
You	can	see	the	poverty	and	slovenliness	in	every	corner	.
The	prisoners	help	us	build	our	farms	.
Byelorussian	,	May	1942	.
--------------------
Journey	to	Russia	will	not	be	a	childish	game	.
This	is	not	a	casual	war	:
It	is	a	mass	genocide	.
Henning	,	you	're	exaggerating	.
This	is	really	happening	,	Claus	.
Just	beyond	the	front	line	.
Incredible	things	you	are	telling	me	.
Your	people	at	the	headquarters	don	't	believe	what	they	hear	each	time	they	're	told	about	that	.
Polja	,	tell	us	what	you	have	seen	.
She	came	to	me	the	other	night	,	being	completely	lost	.
--------------------
Give	this	letter	to	the	Chief	Leadership	.
This	way	it	'll	probably	reach	Berlin	much	faster	.
The	woman	...	...	small	child	...	...	the	old	man	...	...	that	barely	walks	...
"	Lead	on	!	"
"	Move	on	,	Jewish	pussies	!	"
"	Stop	!
Get	undressed	!	"
"	We	're	begging	you	,	no	!	"
A	beautiful	woman	,	an	old	man	...
Everybody	's	crying	...
--------------------
A	child	,	so	young	...
So	tiny	...
Woman	's	mourning	,	she	's	screaming	...
"	My	mite	!	"
They	stick	the	gun	to	the	head	...
The	woman	's	screaming	...
"	Please	,	no	!
I	'm	begging	you	!	"
German	Kommando	surrounded	a	civil	group	...	...	in	her	village	,	not	far	from	here	.
A	group	consisting	of	children	,	old	people	women	and	men	.
--------------------
They	killed	every	one	of	them	with	a	single	headshot	.
912	people	.
Nearly	whole	village	.
That	's	her	family	and	her	kindred	.
There	are	other	villages	.
I	received	reports	of	performing	more	than	30000	executions	in	the	region	.
Horrifying	.
They	are	as	human	as	we	are	.
I	can	't	understand	this	racist	hatred	.
They	thought	of	us	as	of	rescuers	.
--------------------
I	still	hear	their	happy	vivas	.
There	is	only	one	solution	.
Hitler	must	die	.
Now	?
In	the	middle	of	the	war	?
What	about	the	oath	?
He	's	already	broken	it	for	hundred	times	!
We	can	't	detain	any	longer	.
Dear	Nina	!
Some	days	remain	in	our	memory	forever	.
--------------------
Moments	,	when	we	are	unable	to	understand	...	...	our	thoughts	and	past	behavior	.
I	've	never	contemplated	about	my	work	and	my	life	as	much	...	...	as	I	do	now	.
Eastern	Prussia	,	February	1943
Pig	...
Hitler	is	a	son-	of-	a-	bitch	.
Goddamn	him	!
He	doesn	't	understand	what	he	's	saying	.
He	's	way	too	drunk	!
He	lets	thousands	of	our	people	die	in	this	fucking	Stalingrad	.
I	don	't	give	a	shit	about	that	.
--------------------
He	doesn	't	care	about	them	.
General	Fellgiebel	,	please	pull	yourself	together	.
He	's	the	Secret	Service	chief	.
You	'd	better	not	mention	it	so	loud	,	General	.
I	've	to	tell	somebody	about	that	!
Or	else	I	'll	explode	!
That	unscrupulous	pig	cares	only	about	himself	.
People	are	worth	nothing	to	him	!
Enough	!
Will	you	help	me	?
--------------------
Of	course	.
Who	are	you	?
Stauffenberg	.
You	're	right	.
Eastern	Campaign	is	a	military	disaster	.
It	's	a	human	disaster	as	well	.
Fellgiebel	.
If	only	you	had	known	the	facts	the	Secret	Service	officers	know	...
Can	we	talk	about	that	somewhere	else	?
Let	's	go	.
--------------------
Dear	Nina	!
I	can	see	our	homeland	falling	into	the	deep	abyss	...	...	but	I	'm	powerless	.
My	work	at	the	headquarters	is	fruitless	.
I	'll	request	a	transfer	to	Africa	front	.
I	can	't	do	anything	else	.
Tunisia	,	April	1943	.
How	did	you	get	here	?
Lieutenant	Farber	.
I	was	to	report	to	you	.	...	in	order	to	gain	control	of	one	of	your	squads	.
Stauffenberg	.
--------------------
Are	you	from	Germany	?
So	are	you	?
Yes	,	Lautlingen	And	you	?
Boblingen	.
Not	bad	,	isn	't	it	?
Please	,	have	a	seat	.
So	you	are	the	one	who	wants	to	command	one	of	my	squads	?
Yes	.
That	's	why	I	came	here	.
You	won	't	achieve	anything	in	here	.
--------------------
Our	African	adventure	has	reached	its	end	.
Run	!
Get	out	of	the	car	!
Farber	?
For	God	's	sake	!
Don	't	die	.
German	mates	have	to	stick	together	.
Say	something	.
Breathe	.
Yes	!
--------------------
That	's	it	!
Don	't	die	,	Farber	!
Why	haven	't	you	listened	to	me	?	!
Take	a	look	at	this	.
Look	!
I	'm	going	to	the	new	front	line	.
All	right	.
I	'll	wait	here	,	till	the	whole	battalion	passes	.
Yes	,	Sir	.
We	were	supposed	to	leave	yesterday	.
--------------------
I	'm	sorry	.
Top	orders	.
Colonel	!
What	can	you	see	?
A	doctor	.
Where	am	I	?
In	the	military	hospital	In	Monachium	.
We	managed	to	save	one	of	your	eyes	.
One	of	my	eyes	?
You	should	be	glad	that	you	had	managed	to	survive	.
--------------------
We	weren	't	giving	you	the	slightest	chance	.
They	've	already	called	you	"	Dead	"	in	Africa	.
Hello	,	Claus	.
Nina	...
What	have	they	done	to	you	?
"	Among	the	blinded	a	single-	eyed	is	a	king	.	"
I	can	't	even	wipe	your	tears	.
You	've	lost	that	hand	.
They	had	to	amputate	it	back	in	Tunisia	.
What	about	the	wedding	ring	?
--------------------
They	disposed	of	the	hand	.
And	so	they	did	with	the	wedding	ring	.
All	I	can	do	is	to	try	to	eradicate	this	man	.
I	should	have	done	it	a	long	time	ago	.
You	've	to	recover	.
Nothing	more	.
Grunewald	,	September	1943	.
Why	am	I	not	allowed	to	take	off	my	gloves	?
We	don	't	want	to	leave	any	fingerprints	on	the	paper	sheets	.
Safety	reasons	...
--------------------
Now	write	.
Firstly	:
"	Fuhrer	,	Adolf	Hitler	,	is	dead	.	"
"	A	ruthless	parcel	...	"
What	?
"	Fuhrer	,	Adolf	Hitler	,	is	dead	.	"
You	can	't	do	this	!
We	've	got	no	choice	.
The	moment	they	receive	this	he	will	have	already	been	dead	.
Oh	my	God	.
--------------------
Are	you	afraid	?
My	hands	are	shaking	.
You	promised	you	would	help	us	.
I	am	.
All	right	.
The	first	sentence	is	:
"	Fuhrer	,	Adolf	Hitler	,	is	dead	.	"
Exclamation	mark	.
"	A	ruthless	parcel	...	of	inexperienced	careerists	...	took	advantage	of	the	situation	...	and	did	a	major	hit	to	the	soldiers	,	fighting	on	the	front	line	.	"
But	that	's	not	true	...
--------------------
Prevarication	;	nobody	should	know	,	who	's	responsible	for	the	state	spar	.
"	In	this	tense	moment	...	...	the	authorities	have	decided	to	introduce	...	...	means	that	are	necessary	for	attaining	...	...	order	and	calmness	.	"
SS	!
What	about	the	notes	?
It	's	too	late	.
Who	is	she	?
Does	she	live	here	?
If	she	did	,	I	'd	have	known	it	.
What	kind	of	answer	is	that	?
Good	night	.
--------------------
I	'm	Colonel	von	Tresckow	.
And	that	's	Colonel	von	Stauffenberg	.
All	right	.
Follow	me	.
Shoot	them	if	they	try	to	escape	!
Surround	the	house	and	cover	all	the	entrances	.
That	was	close	.
What	is	it	?
I	'm	scared	.
I	'm	really	afraid	of	dying	on	the	gibbet	.
--------------------
We	have	to	burn	all	the	notes	and	hide	the	typescript	.
I	know	,	Margaretha	.
I	know	that	we	all	are	risking	our	lives	here	.
You	can	still	leave	.
I	can	't	.
And	I	don	't	want	to	.
Bamberg	,	July	1944	.
Children	came	to	say	:
Good-	night	.
Who	wants	to	be	the	first	one	?
--------------------
Good	night	,	daddy	.
Good	night	,	my	little	Valerie	.
Sweet	dreams	.
Can	I	...	?
Next	time	.
Good	night	,	dad	.
And	Heil	Hitler	!
Where	did	you	get	that	from	?
From	grandma	'	.
You	know	my	mother	.
--------------------
Let	God	take	care	of	you	.
You	can	go	to	your	beds	now	.
Good	night	,	giant	.
Come	closer	.
Hugs	are	important	.
Between	men	as	well	.
Sleep	well	.
What	do	you	need	that	gun	for	?
Just	in	case	.
Burn	those	papers	.
--------------------
Inappropriate	people	shouldn	't	find	them	.
Is	there	something	else	?
Are	you	angry	at	me	?
What	time	does	the	train	leave	?
According	to	the	departure	board	,	at	12	:	20PM	.
It	won	't	wait	.
The	German	are	punctual	-	-	even	during	the	war	.
You	're	exaggerating	.
Maybe	.
Or	maybe	I	'm	just	saying	that	in	order	not	to	think	about	something	else	.
